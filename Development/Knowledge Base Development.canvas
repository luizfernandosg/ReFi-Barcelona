		{"id":"c951e1800a396b2e","type":"text","text":"## Issues Setup\n\nUsing GitHub Issues to update a knowledge base hosted in a GitHub repository can be an efficient and collaborative way to manage content updates. This process involves using Issues to track suggestions, corrections, or additions to your knowledge base, and then updating the repository based on these issues. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up and using this system:\n\n### 1. Create a Standard Process for Issues\n- **Issue Templates:** Set up issue templates in your GitHub repository to standardize how contributors report different types of updates (e.g., corrections, new entries, updates to existing entries).\n- **Labels:** Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., \"correction\", \"new entry\", \"enhancement\"). This helps in organizing and prioritizing the issues.\n\n### 2. Contributing to the Knowledge Base via Issues\n- **Reporting Updates:** Contributors can create an issue to suggest a new entry or an update to an existing one. They should provide detailed information, including where in the knowledge base the change applies and what the proposed change is.\n- **Discussion and Review:** Team members and other contributors can discuss the proposed changes in the issue's comment section. This can include asking for clarifications, suggesting further edits, or approving the proposed changes.\n- **Assigning Issues:** Assign issues to specific team members for handling and resolution. This ensures accountability and tracks who is responsible for which update.\n\n### 3. Updating the Knowledge Base\n- **Branching:** Once an issue is approved for update, create a new branch in the repository for making these changes. This keeps the main branch stable and allows for review and revision before changes go live.\n- **Making Changes:** Update the Markdown files or other documents in the knowledge base as per the issue. If the changes are significant, it might be beneficial to involve the original issue creator for a review.\n- **Pull Requests:** Once changes are made, open a pull request. Link the pull request to the issue it resolves (you can do this by mentioning the issue number in the pull request description).\n- **Review Process:** Have a review process in place for pull requests. This could involve technical reviews, content checks, or editorial reviews.\n- **Merging:** After the pull request is reviewed and approved, merge it into the main branch. This will update the knowledge base with the new changes.\n\n### 4. Closing Issues\n- **Automatic Closing:** Use keywords like \"fixes\" or \"closes\" followed by the issue number in your pull request description to automatically close the related issue when the pull request is merged.\n- **Manual Closing:** If automatic closing is not used, manually close the issue once the corresponding update is merged into the main branch.\n\n### 5. Documentation and Training\n- **Contribution Guidelines:** Document the process for using issues to update the knowledge base. Include instructions for creating issues, the review process, and how to make updates.\n- **Training Contributors:** If necessary, provide training or resources for contributors to understand how to effectively use GitHub Issues for this purpose.\n\n### 6. Automation (Optional)\n- **GitHub Actions:** Consider using GitHub Actions to automate parts of this workflow. For example, you could automatically label issues based on certain keywords, or set up notifications when issues are opened, closed, or need attention.\n\n### 7. Regular Audits and Cleanup\n- **Issue Audits:** Periodically review open issues to keep the repository clean and ensure that all proposed updates are being addressed.\n- **Stale Issues:** Use bots or manual processes to identify and close stale issues that are no longer relevant or have been forgotten.\n\nBy using GitHub Issues in this way, you create a transparent, traceable, and collaborative process for maintaining and enhancing your knowledge base. This not only improves the quality of the content but also engages the community in the content development process.","x":7304,"y":23626,"width":455,"height":415},
		{"id":"61f71aa649751831","type":"text","text":"# Issues workflow\n\nYes, the Forking Workflow can work very well in conjunction with a GitHub Issues-based setup for managing contributions to a knowledge base or any collaborative project. Here's how these two systems complement each other:\n\n### 1. **Issue Tracking and Discussion**\n- **Centralized Discussion:** GitHub Issues provide a centralized platform for discussing potential changes, bugs, or new features. Contributors can open issues to propose changes or report problems.\n- **Community Engagement:** Issues allow for broader community engagement. Contributors, including those who may not be actively coding, can participate in discussions, provide insights, or suggest improvements.\n\n### 2. **Linking Issues with Pull Requests**\n- **Reference Issues in PRs:** When contributors submit a pull request from their fork, they can reference the relevant issue. This creates a direct link between the discussion (in the issue) and the proposed changes (in the pull request).\n- **Automatic Linking:** GitHub automatically links issues and pull requests when you mention an issue number in a pull request description or commit message. This helps maintainers keep track of which pull requests address which issues.\n\n### 3. **Organized Contribution Process**\n- **Structured Workflow:** The combination of GitHub Issues and the Forking Workflow creates a structured and organized process. Issues are used for proposing and discussing changes, while the Forking Workflow is used for implementing and reviewing those changes.\n- **Transparency:** This setup maintains transparency in the development process. All discussions, code reviews, and changes are visible and traceable through issues and pull requests.\n\n### 4. **Quality Control and Review**\n- **Peer Reviews:** Pull requests in the Forking Workflow undergo peer review before being merged. Linking these PRs to specific issues ensures that the changes are relevant and in line with what was discussed.\n- **Collaborative Improvements:** Through issues and PRs, multiple contributors can work together to improve a proposal, enhancing the quality of contributions.\n\n### 5. **Maintaining Project Integrity**\n- **Fork Isolation:** In the Forking Workflow, contributors work on their own forks, ensuring that the main repository remains stable. This is particularly important for a knowledge base where accuracy and reliability are crucial.\n- **Controlled Merging:** Maintainers have control over what gets merged into the main repository. They can ensure that only changes that have been properly vetted and discussed through issues and reviewed in PRs make it to the final project.\n\n### 6. **Continuous Improvement and Updating**\n- **Iterative Updates:** The combination of issues for discussion and feedback, along with fork-based pull requests for actual changes, supports an iterative approach to improving the knowledge base.\n- **Evolving Content:** As new issues arise and new insights are gained, the content of the knowledge base can evolve in a controlled and efficient manner.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe integration of GitHub Issues with the Forking Workflow offers a robust framework for managing and contributing to collaborative projects. It provides a clear path from idea and discussion (via issues) to implementation and integration (via forked repositories and pull requests), ensuring a high level of organization, transparency, and quality control.","x":7999,"y":23694,"width":402,"height":275},

It allows anyone to contribute without requiring write access to the main repository. This document outlines the branching strategy and process for utilizing the Forking Workflow in our project.\n\n## Overview of the Forking Workflow\nIn the Forking Workflow, each contributor has two Git repositories: a private fork and the official repository. Contributors make changes in their private fork and then submit a pull request to merge their changes into the official repository.\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### 1. Fork the Official Repository\n- **Create a Fork:** Contributors start by forking the official repository. A fork is a personal copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the original project.\n- **Clone the Fork:** After forking, clone your fork to your local machine. This is where you will make your changes.\n\n  ```bash\n  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git\n  ```\n\n### 2. Keep Your Fork Updated\n- **Add Remote Upstream:** To keep your fork up to date with the official repository, add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.\n\n  ```bash\n  git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/official-repo.git\n  ```\n\n- **Fetch Upstream Changes:** Regularly fetch changes from the `upstream` remote.\n\n  ```bash\n  git fetch upstream\n  ```\n\n- **Merge Changes:** Merge these changes from the upstream main branch into your local main branch.\n\n  ```bash\n  git checkout main\n  git merge upstream/main\n  ```\n\n### 3. Create a New Branch for Your Work\n- **Branching:** Always create a new branch for your work, rather than working directly on the main branch. This helps in isolating different features or fixes.\n\n  ```bash\n  git checkout -b feature-branch-name\n  ```\n\n### 4. Make Changes and Commit\n- **Commit Changes:** Make your changes in your local repository and commit them. Be sure to write clear and detailed commit messages.\n\n  ```bash\n  git commit -m \"Detailed commit message\"\n  ```\n\n### 5. Push Changes to Your Fork\n- **Push to Fork:** Once your changes are committed, push the branch to your fork on GitHub.\n\n  ```bash\n  git push origin feature-branch-name\n  ```\n\n### 6. Submit a Pull Request\n- **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the official repository on GitHub, and create a new pull request. Base your pull request from the branch you've just pushed to your fork.\n- **PR Description:** In your pull request, provide a detailed description of the changes and reference any related issues.\n- **Await Review:** Wait for the project maintainers to review your pull request. Be responsive to any feedback or requests for changes.\n\n### 7. After PR Merging\n- **Delete Your Branch:** After your pull request has been merged, you can safely delete your branch.\n- **Sync Your Fork:** Don’t forget to sync your fork with the official repository to get the latest changes.\n\n### 8. Best Practices\n- **Stay Updated:** Regularly pull changes from the upstream repository to avoid conflicts.\n- **Small, Focused Changes:** Keep your pull requests small and focused on a single feature or fix for easier review.\n- **Follow Project Guidelines:** Adhere to any coding standards, guidelines, and best practices provided by the project maintainers.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Forking Workflow allows for a highly decentralized development process, providing each contributor with their sandbox while maintaining the integrity of the official project repository. By following these guidelines, contributors can effectively participate in the project while ensuring a smooth and organized development process.","x":8600,"y":23163,"width":463,"height":463},
		{"id":"14c25382c728a002","type":"text","text":"## Branches Setup\n\nTo effectively manage branches in your GitHub repository, especially when multiple contributors are involved or when maintaining a public-facing project like a knowledge base, it's important to have a clear branch setup and strategy. This setup typically involves branch naming conventions, branch protection rules, and possibly the use of a branching model like Git Flow. Here’s how you can set this up on GitHub:\n\n### 1. **Branch Naming Conventions**\n- **Define Naming Rules:** Establish clear naming conventions for branches. This could be based on the purpose of the branch (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`) or the issue it addresses (e.g., `issue-123-description`).\n- **Communicate Conventions:** Document and share these conventions with all contributors to ensure consistency.\n\n### 2. **Branch Protection Rules**\nBranch protection rules help maintain the integrity of your main branch (often `main` or `master`) and can also be applied to other important branches (like `develop` in a Git Flow model).\n\n- **Access GitHub Repository Settings:** Go to your repository on GitHub, click on \"Settings,\" and then navigate to \"Branches\" in the sidebar.\n- **Create Rules for Main Branch:**\n  - **Prevent Direct Pushes:** Disallow direct pushes to the main branch. This ensures that all changes go through a review process via pull requests.\n  - **Require Pull Request Reviews:** Set up the requirement for pull requests to be reviewed and approved before they can be merged into the main branch.\n  - **Status Checks:** You can enforce status checks to pass before merging, ensuring that tests or other CI processes complete successfully.\n  - **Include Administrators:** Apply these rules to everyone, including repository administrators.\n- **Additional Rules for Other Branches:** You might want to apply similar rules to other branches, like a `develop` branch, depending on your workflow.\n\n### 3. **Branching Strategy**\n- **Choose a Strategy:** Decide on a branching strategy that suits your project’s workflow. Common strategies include:\n  - **Feature Branch Workflow:** Create branches for each new feature, merge them back to the main branch upon completion.\n  - **Git Flow:** A robust model involving branches like `feature`, `develop`, `release`, and `hotfix`.\n  - **Forking Workflow:** Contributors fork the repository, make changes in their copy, and submit pull requests.\n- **Document the Strategy:** Clearly document your chosen strategy in the repository, typically in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, so that all contributors understand the process.\n\n### 4. **Automations (Optional)**\n- **GitHub Actions for Branch Management:** Automate certain branch management tasks using GitHub Actions. For example, automatically delete feature branches once their pull requests are merged.\n\n### 5. **Regular Audits and Cleanup**\n- **Branch Cleanup:** Regularly review and delete stale or merged branches to keep the repository tidy and manageable.\n\n### 6. **Training and Guidelines for Contributors**\n- **Provide Guidance:** Offer clear guidelines and possibly training materials for contributors on how to create and manage branches according to your repository’s rules and conventions.\n\nBy setting up these branch management practices, you create a more organized, efficient, and error-resistant workflow for your GitHub repository. This setup is particularly important for collaborative projects and open-source repositories where multiple contributors are working simultaneously on different aspects of the project.","x":7280,"y":23076,"width":503,"height":459},
		{"id":"f7315e31a8b7340f","type":"text","text":"# Branching Workflow\n\nBranching strategies and naming conventions are crucial for managing software development projects, especially when working in teams. They help in organizing work, tracking progress, and ensuring a smooth workflow. Let's delve into various branching strategies and naming conventions:\n\n## Branching Strategies\n\n### 1. **Feature Branch Workflow**\n- **Concept:** Developers create a new branch for every new feature or bug fix. \n- **Advantages:** Isolates development work from the main codebase, allowing for experimentation and error without affecting the main project.\n- **Usage:** Particularly useful in projects where continuous integration is practiced.\n\n### 2. **Git Flow**\n- **Concept:** Involves multiple branch types: `feature`, `develop`, `release`, and `hotfix`.\n- **Process:** \n  - Development happens in `feature` branches.\n  - `feature` branches merge into `develop`.\n  - When ready for a release, `develop` is merged into `release`.\n  - After release, `release` is merged into `main` (or `master`) and `develop`.\n  - Urgent fixes are made in `hotfix` branches which merge directly into `main` and `develop`.\n- **Advantages:** Provides a robust framework suitable for managing larger projects.\n\n### 3. **GitHub Flow**\n- **Concept:** A simplified version of Git Flow, more suited for projects that deploy regularly.\n- **Process:** \n  - Create feature branches for new features and fixes.\n  - Merge these branches into the main branch after review.\n  - Deploy from the main branch.\n- **Advantages:** Simplicity and continuous delivery are the key benefits.\n\n### 4. **Trunk-Based Development**\n- **Concept:** Developers work in short-lived branches or directly in the trunk (the main branch).\n- **Process:** \n  - Branches are merged back to the trunk frequently, often daily.\n  - Releases are made through release branches or tags on the trunk.\n- **Advantages:** Promotes continuous integration and reduces merge conflicts due to frequent integration.\n\n### 5. **Release Branching**\n- **Concept:** Focuses on creating branches for each release.\n- **Process:** \n  - Development continues in the main branch.\n  - A new release branch is created for each release cycle.\n  - Only bug fixes and necessary changes are pushed to these branches.\n- **Advantages:** Useful for maintaining multiple versions and managing releases systematically.\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n### 1. **Feature Branches**\n- **Pattern:** `feature/<feature-name>` or `feature/JIRA-123`\n- **Example:** `feature/add-login`, `feature/JIRA-123`\n- **Purpose:** Used for specific feature development.\n\n### 2. **Bug Fix Branches**\n- **Pattern:** `bugfix/<bug-name>` or `bugfix/JIRA-123`\n- **Example:** `bugfix/fix-login-error`, `bugfix/JIRA-124`\n- **Purpose:** Dedicated to fixing bugs.\n\n### 3. **Release Branches**\n- **Pattern:** `release/<version>` or `release/<date>`\n- **Example:** `release/1.2.0`, `release/Oct2023`\n- **Purpose:** For preparing releases.\n\n### 4. **Hotfix Branches**\n- **Pattern:** `hotfix/<issue-name>` or `hotfix/<version>`\n- **Example:** `hotfix/urgent-login-fix`, `hotfix/1.2.1`\n- **Purpose:** For urgent fixes that need immediate deployment.\n\n### 5. **Development Branches**\n- **Pattern:** `develop` or `dev`\n- **Example:** `develop`, `dev`\n- **Purpose:** Main development branch, used in Git Flow.\n\n### Best Practices\n- **Consistency:** Adhere to a chosen naming convention throughout the project.\n- **Clarity:** The branch name should clearly indicate its purpose.\n- **Brevity:** Keep names short yet descriptive.\n- **Standardization:** Establish a standard across the team or organization.\n\nEach branching strategy and naming convention has its strengths and is best chosen based on the specific needs of the project and the team's workflow. Consistency and clarity in these strategies help in maintaining an efficient and manageable development process.","x":7990,"y":23207,"width":411,"height":328},

The Forking Workflow is an excellent approach for collaborative projects, allowing contributors to work independently without needing direct access to the main repository. Here’s how you can contribute using GitHub’s web interface.\n\n## Overview\nIn the Forking Workflow, each contributor works on their copy (fork) of the repository. Changes are made in this personal repository and then submitted back to the original repository via pull requests.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### 1. Fork the Official Repository\n- **Forking:** Go to the official repository’s GitHub page. Click on the “Fork” button at the top right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.\n- **Clone to Your Account:** The forked repository is automatically cloned to your account and can be found under your repositories.\n\n### 2. Keep Your Fork Updated\n- **Sync with the Main Repository:** Regularly sync your fork with the main repository to get the latest updates.\n- **Pull Request Method:** Create a pull request in your fork to merge changes from the original repository to your fork. This can be done using GitHub's UI.\n\n### 3. Create a New Branch\n- **Branching in UI:** In your forked repository, click on the “Branch” dropdown menu (usually at the top left, next to the repository name). Enter a name for your new branch and click “Create branch.”\n\n### 4. Make Changes Using GitHub UI\n- **Edit Files:** Navigate to the file you want to edit in your new branch. Click on the pencil icon (Edit) to start making changes.\n- **Commit Changes:** After making changes, scroll down to the “Commit changes” section. Enter a commit message that describes your changes and commit directly to your new branch.\n\n### 5. Create a Pull Request\n- **Open a Pull Request:** Once you’ve committed your changes, navigate to the “Pull Requests” tab in the original repository and click “New Pull Request.”\n- **Select Your Branch:** Choose your fork and branch as the source for the pull request. The base repository should be the original one where you want to merge your changes.\n- **Fill Out the Pull Request Form:** Add a title and description for your pull request. Mention any relevant issues by number.\n\n### 6. Review and Merge Process\n- **Wait for Review:** The maintainers of the original repository will review your pull request. They may request changes or additional information.\n- **Respond to Feedback:** If changes are requested, you can make them in the same branch and they will automatically be added to your pull request.\n\n### 7. Final Steps\n- **Pull Request Merging:** Once your pull request is approved, the maintainers will merge it into the main repository.\n- **Delete Your Branch (Optional):** After merging, you can delete the branch from your fork if it’s no longer needed.\n\n### Best Practices\n- **Stay Current:** Regularly update your fork to keep it in sync with the main repository.\n- **Clear Commit Messages:** Write clear and detailed commit messages to explain your changes.\n- **Small, Focused Changes:** Keep changes small and focused on a single issue or feature for easier review.\n\n## Conclusion\nUsing the GitHub UI for the Forking Workflow allows you to contribute to projects without the need for command-line tools. This approach ensures that everyone, regardless of their technical background, can participate in the collaborative process.\n\n","x":8800,"y":22040,"width":690,"height":405},

This guide is tailored for individuals who may not be familiar with GitHub. We’ll cover each component of the infrastructure and explain how they work together to facilitate an efficient and collaborative contribution process.\n\n## Introduction to GitHub\n\nGitHub is a platform that hosts repositories (repos) for version control and collaboration. It allows multiple people to work on projects simultaneously. In the context of our knowledge base, we use GitHub to manage and update the content collaboratively.\n\n### Key Terms\n- **Repository (Repo):** A digital directory where all the project files are stored, along with their revision history.\n- **Issue:** A feature in GitHub used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.\n- **Pull Request (PR):** A method to submit contributions to the project. It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository.\n- **Branch:** A parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the primary or main branch, allowing you to work freely without disrupting the live project.\n\n## 1. Repository Setup\nA repository is where our knowledge base is stored. It contains all the files and their revision history. Think of it as a folder on your computer, but hosted online and accessible to authorized individuals.\n\n## 2. Issue Templates\nIssues in GitHub are used to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, or other types of work within a repository. We use issue templates to standardize how contributors report different types of updates to the knowledge base. \n\n- **Creating an Issue:** If you want to suggest a change or an addition, you go to the 'Issues' tab in the repository and create a new issue using one of our predefined templates.\n- **Templates:** These templates have fields you fill out to describe your suggestion, ensuring that all necessary information is provided for a smooth review and implementation process.\n\n## 3. Labeling System\nLabels are like tags or categories applied to issues. We use them to organize and prioritize work. For example, labels can categorize issues as `new entry`, `update`, `correction`, etc.\n\n## 4. Contribution Guidelines\nWe provide a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the repository. This document outlines how to contribute to the knowledge base, including:\n\n- **How to Use Issues:** Detailed instructions on creating and submitting issues.\n- **Review Process:** An explanation of how your suggestions will be reviewed and implemented.\n- **Style Guidelines:** If there are specific style guidelines or formats to follow, they will be listed here.\n\n## 5. Branch Protection Rules\nTo ensure the integrity of our knowledge base, the main branch (the primary version of the repository) is protected. Changes can only be made through a controlled process, involving what's known as a pull request.\n\n- **Making Changes:** When you want to make changes, you don’t edit the main branch directly. Instead, you create a new branch where you can make changes without affecting the main version.\n- **Pull Requests:** Once you're done with your changes in the new branch, you create a pull request. This is a request to merge your changes into the main branch.\n\n## 6.

Its efforts are geared towards creating a global network of local nodes, each contributing uniquely to this transformative movement.\n\n## Mission, Vision, and Values\n\nReFi DAO's mission encompasses developing strategic services and public goods for the ReFi ecosystem. This includes wide-ranging activities like movement-wide sense-making, education, opportunity development, fundraising support, onboarding, and empowerment through diverse platforms, including online interfaces, multimedia, and community coordination. At the heart of these endeavors is the incubation and support of ReFi Local Nodes worldwide, fostering a cosmo-local network for a regenerative economy.\n\n## The Role of Local Nodes\n\nReFi DAO is actively building a decentralized network of regionally-based local communities, each sharing the mission to regenerate the Earth using contemporary tools. These Local Nodes, envisioned as autonomous yet interconnected local impact DAOs, begin with simple meet-ups and events and may evolve to acquire land and other real-world assets. This progression aims to nurture locally-based regenerative economies and communities【19†source】.\n\n### Local Node Prize and Incubator Program\n\nReFi DAO, in collaboration with Commons Stack, has launched a prize to incubate the first ReFi DAO Local Node in the Global South, alongside a Node in Lisbon. This initiative seeks a city in the Global South to join the Alpha Cohort of the Local Node Incubator. The program guides Prize winners through deploying their Local Node, including collective fund-raising, token economy design, governance establishment, token launch, and proposal passing. ReFi DAO and Commons Stack offer comprehensive support throughout this process, with Local Nodes representing a foundational element in the network state architecture explored by ReFi DAO【20†source】.\n\n### Activities and Events\n\nLocal Nodes participate in a Gitcoin Beta subset round, raising funds for community gathering and local events, supported by ReFi Event Organizers Guild and ReFi Spring. These activities aim to cultivate shared visions of regeneration and form core teams competing for the Local Node Prize【20†source】.\n\n### Criteria for a Successful Application\n\nFor a successful Local Node application, certain criteria must be met. These include a commitment from experienced founders, a detailed vision for city regeneration, identification of key local partners, and a detailed budget for 24 months【20†source】.\n\n## ReFi DAO's Broader Activities\n\nReFi DAO is also involved in various other initiatives, as evidenced by their activities and publications on their Mirror platform. These include strategic overviews of regeneration, explorations of the role of Web3 in driving innovation and problem-solving, and recaps of key moments and organizations in the ReFi movement【21†source】.\n\nIn summary, ReFi DAO's Local Nodes are more than just community hubs; they are integral to the DAO's vision of a globally coordinated, locally enacted regenerative economy. These nodes are pivotal in translating the ReFi ethos into tangible, on-the-ground action and impact.","x":-2160,"y":14940,"width":690,"height":400,"color":"3"},

This [[ecosystem map]] is a dynamic resource, curated to illuminate the intricate network we are navigating with ReFi BCN. Our goal is to bring visibility, and hopefully support, to the thriving ecosystem of ReFi-aligned initiatives around Barcelona.\n\n## Understanding ReFi-Aligned Projects\n\nBefore diving into our local and global landscapes, let's address a crucial question: What exactly are ReFi-aligned projects? The answer is not straightforward as these projects are diverse and subjective in nature. However, they share common threads of aligning with the principles of Regenerative Finance (ReFi). Here, we present a selection of initiatives we've encountered in Barcelona that have inspired us with their approach to sustainability, community empowerment, and innovation.\n\n## Local Landscape: Barcelona and Catalonia\n\nBarcelona, a vibrant hub of innovation and collaboration, presents a unique canvas for ReFi-aligned activities. We are diving into several key areas:\n\n- [ ] **[[ReFi-aligned landscape of Barcelona]]**  \n  Exploring Barcelona's initiatives and projects that align with ReFi principles, focusing on sustainable finance and community empowerment.\n\n- [ ] **[[Social Economy in Barcelona and Catalonia]]**  \n  Investigating the region's social economy sector, which includes cooperatives, mutuals, nonprofits, and social enterprises, and its interplay with ReFi models.\n\n- [ ] **[[Cooperative landscape of Barcelona and Catalonia]]**  \n  Mapping out the extensive network of cooperatives in Barcelona and Catalonia, understanding their contributions to local economies and social structures.\n\n- [ ] **[[Barcelona and the Web3 Ecosystem]]**  \n  Delving into how Barcelona is integrating into the Web3 landscape, with a focus on blockchain technologies and decentralized applications.\n\n- [ ] **[[Barcelona and Participatory Technology]]**  \n  Assessing how participatory technology tools are being utilized in Barcelona to foster community engagement and decentralized decision-making.\n\n- [ ] **[[Barcelona and the Ecological Transition]]**  \n  Examining Barcelona's strategies and initiatives towards ecological sustainability and how they intersect with ReFi principles.\n\n## Global Context: ReFi and Web3\n\nBeyond our local environment, we recognize the global nature of the ReFi and Web3 movements. We aim to connect with and learn from:\n\n- [ ] **[[ReFi Ecosystem]]**  \n  Understanding the global ReFi landscape, including key players, networks, and projects that are pioneering regenerative finance worldwide.\n\n- [ ] **Web3 Funding Mechanisms**  \n  Exploring innovative funding models in the Web3 space, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), grants, and community funding, which can support sustainable and regenerative projects.\n\n## Collaboration and Open-Source Ethos\n\nOur mission extends beyond local boundaries. We embrace an open-source ethos, believing that transparency and collaboration are paramount for collective growth and impact. This website and knowledge base are designed to be shared and adapted, inviting other local nodes and groups to engage with and expand upon our work.\n\nDiscover more about the [[ReFi BCN Knowledge Base]], and feel free to fork it for application in your own context.
