3.2 The phases of multi-stakeholder bioregional
    regeneration As seen in the pioneering and successful work of both Bioregional Weaving Labs and Regenerate Cascadia, efforts can be organized in 5 phases of Preparation, Mapping and Analysis, Convening and Activation, Co-initiation and Co-creation, and finally Co-evolution. This is, accordingly, a process that organizing teams may want to follow, and is outlined below (also see Table 4 for an overview).

The initial phase of Preparation allows the Bioregional Organizing Team to form, clarify roles, and build a shared understanding of the mission – stewarding the regeneration of their bioregion. Often, this team of intrinsically motivated and dedicated individuals is “hosted” by one or more already established backbone106 organizations that allows the team to use its facilities and provides it with initial resources. The hosting organization is usually a mission-oriented entity that already seeks to drive change in the region in some way.

During the second phase, Mapping and Analysis, the organizing team convenes local Indigenous peoples and residents alongside subject matter experts to share their unique knowledge of place in order to better understand the current state of the region and the small watersheds and landscapes within it. This phase comprises a combination of participatory processes such as place mapping and high-level mapping of biophysical, social, and economic systems; assets and opportunities; and risks, needs, or challenges (see Table 3.). These become powerful tools for analysis and decision making, and enable the development of a shared and coherent story of place that can be built on in later phases. Particular                                        Story of place – A holistic attention should be given to stocks and flows of natural assets (including potential                                       narrative that integrates the uplift).107 The 4 Losses and 4 Returns108 approach can be used in this process.                                            history, ecology, culture, and

In the Mapping and Analysis phase, the organizing team will also seek to understand potential levers for systemic change, and to establish a high-level Theory of Change112. Key stakeholders and their relationships will be mapped, the boundaries of the bioregion may begin to be defined (see Section 2.1), and an overview of already established change initiatives, both incremental and systemic, will be created. Finally, an initial mapping of potential investment sources for the organizing team and for bioregional interventions more broadly can be a useful step during this phase.

In the third phase, Convening and Activation, the organizing team facilitates multiple forums and activities, deliberately including a wide range of stakeholder groups in collective and highly participatory processes to drive deep biocultural regeneration as outlined above. Integrating community art, ritual, ceremony, and conviviality into this activation phase enables networks of trust to form, from which a shared vision for the landscape is co-created for example, in the form of a manifesto (see BWL South East Ireland case study). This joint vision serves as the foundation for the subsequent development of a long-term Bioregional Regeneration Strategy, such as the BIOREGIONAL PLAN 2030 of the Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance. This ‘living blueprint’ to protect 86 million acres of bio-culturally diverse tropical rainforests was developed through a three-and-a-half year participatory process. 30 Indigenous nations in Ecuador and Peru drew on their Indigenous stewardship visions and practices, and the principles of “Buen Vivir” (an Indigenous approach to collective well-being), to identify “solution pathways”.113

When it is time to move into the fourth phase of Co-initiation and Co-creation, the organizing team may want to establish or empower the establishment of one or several stand-alone Bioregional Hubs, as outlined in Section 3.3, that can help enhance local capacity and prepare projects for potential investments. A key focus in this phase is placed on aligning existing initiatives with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy, and amplifying their impact in accordance with the strategy. Simultaneously, the engagement of activated stakeholders may lead to the inception of new projects and initiatives. Drawing inspiration from successful models elsewhere, proven solutions can be adapted to suit the unique context of the bioregion. It is in this phase that we also suggest properly setting up BFFs, as detailed in Section 4. This includes the meticulous identification of a decentralized governance structure that empowers citizens to become decision-makers in financial resource allocation and the recruitment of a skilled management team. To broaden the scope of the bioregional regeneration process and to democratize agency, additional stakeholders are invited to engage, while efforts are made to explore and adapt cutting-edge bioregional governance systems. A concerted communication strategy can be implemented to share learnings and efforts with the wider public, and channels may be established for effective communication with neighboring bioregions, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.

Throughout all phases, it is important to understand this process as Co-evolution: a continuous cycle of adaptive iterations. Learnings need to be integrated on an ongoing basis and actions adapted to emergent developments114 in complex undertakings such as bioregional regeneration through a bottom-up multistakeholder approach. Mutual exchange of learnings and insights with regeneration teams of other bioregions can inform the process and create a strong tapestry of bioregional work around the world.

While these phases can be initiated in a linear fashion, they can also be referenced nonlinearly through an ecosystem approach, particularly for bioregions with an extensive history of organizing. For example, Mapping & Analysis and Co-evolution may happen throughout all phases, supporting iterative sense-making and learning for robust Co-initiation and Co-creation activities. See Regenerate Cascadia's case study as an example of a large bioregion with extensive bioregional organizing history engaging these phases nonlinearly. 113 The bioregional plan seeks to address five shared bioregional objectives: improving living conditions, advancing
    Indigenous rights and territorial governance, stopping deforestation and degradation, conserving forests and
    restoring degraded areas, and stopping the advancement of extractive industries (Amazon Sacred Headwaters). 114 More on working with emergence in adrienne marie brown’s book Emergent Strategy.

   The Bioregional Weaving Lab in South East Ireland
   – An Example of a Multi-stakeholder Process for
   Bioregional Regeneration
   By Sarah Prosser & Karin Müller

   About Bioregional Weaving Labs
   A Bioregional Weaving Lab (BWL) is a geographically grounded, multi-stakeholder
   partnership process that connects place, people, and projects to regenerate
   bioregions. It builds capacity and supports local Changemakers and their
   communities, including regenerative farmers, social entrepreneurs, leaders in public
   institutions, corporate leaders, NGOs, students, educators etc., in coordinating

  collective action for the required change on a systemic level. The idea is that an
  inclusive process leads to more local ownership and better implementation of more
  resilient and effective strategies to accelerate the uptake and scaling of regenerative
  practices – like agro-ecology, agroforestry, seagrass restoration, and other Nature-
  based Solutions.
  The BWL approach combines the emerging leadership practice of ‘Weaving’, with a
  Theory U-inspired lab process and a holistic impact framework to generate 4 Returns
  in the bioregions (natural, social, and financial returns, and the return of inspiration).
  Each BWL is led by one or a small team of dedicated ‘Weavers’, often hosted by strong
  local partner organizations, and supported by the international BWL Backbone Team.
  All the bioregional weaving teams across Europe are participating in the overarching
  BWL Learning Network with regular online sessions and an annual Learning Summit to
  catalyze peer-to-peer learning. Apart from the Learning Network, the BWL collective
  is building a growing portfolio of systemic, regenerative innovations and practices
  from all over the world – including from Ashoka Fellows – that are community-
  based, replicable and scalable, and can inspire and support the bioregions in their
  regenerative landscape development.
  The Bioregional Weaving Labs (BWL) Collective is a growing international alliance that
  currently consists of 30+ organizations, including Ashoka and Commonland, working
  together to mobilize one million Changemakers to restore, protect and regenerate
  one million hectares of land and sea in Europe by 2030. The Collective is representing
  hundreds of practitioners in the field, like farmers and nature conservationists, and has
  the ambition to grow into an international movement of regenerative Changemakers.
  Since January 2022, the Bioregional Weaving Labs Collective has activated
  25 Weavers facilitating 8 BWLs in 8 countries in Europe: Ireland, Germany, The
  Netherlands, Austria, Romania, France, Spain, and Poland.
  BWL South East Ireland
  The BWL in South East Ireland, was one of the first ones to be established and has
  since facilitated a series of place-based trust-building activities as well as regular
  multi-stakeholder workshops with farmers, local institutions and social innovators in
  the bioregion. The workshops are designed to look at systemic and mindset changes
  needed for landscape transformation through collective action, and have proven to be
  a space where isolated initiatives find strength in numbers and a sense of belonging.
  The South East of Ireland is dominated by intensive agricultural practices, mostly dairy
  and beef, supplying a major export market, with smaller areas of upland features along
  the northern edge of the bioregion, and a craggy coastline to the south facing out to
  the Celtic Sea and the Atlantic beyond. The effects of extractive business practices
  and broken food systems are becoming increasingly visible in this superficially green
  and thriving corner of Europe. Water quality is poor in many of the rivers, dairy farming
  has reached a point where the carrying capacity of the land and soil is exceeded, and
  communities are detached from nature, and each other, due to urban growth and shifts
  in social connections in rural settings. There is an increasing awareness of the fragility
  of the situation and the harmful effects of such systems. There is also an increasing
  determination to do something that will restore and regenerate the region, but there is
  little access to knowledge or demonstrations of how to make such a major change.
  An early initiative in the work of the Irish BWL was to give local stakeholders ownership
  of their own vision for the future of their food systems - and the changes that will be
  needed in local natural and social structures to get there. They did this by co-writing this
  powerful manifesto that now guides the direction and content of the BWL work in Ireland.

. The Enabling Environtment for 
   The multiple activities and initiatives led by the BWL in South East Ireland represent
   both the tangible and intangible aspects of transformative change. The weaving staff
   support local projects with micro catalyst grants, and by creating shared language
   and sharing tools that facilitate systemic and collective change. Events have included
   landscape walks and artistic interventions, as well as formal workshops and seminars.
   Over the course of 18 months, ten concepts have emerged as being both innovative
   and potentially collectively impactful in their ability to achieve the shared vision in the
   manifesto and contribute to the overall mission of the European BWL collective. The
   concepts range from new kinds of regenerative farming to rural hubs, from upland
   sustainability through generations to unleashing the social capital of the third age116,
   and from a mission-driven geopark to stiching nature corridors together across the
   bioregion.
   In addition, the BWL in South East Ireland is involved in a ‘deep demonstration’
   partnership with the Irish government to test landscape approaches to the future of
   sustainable dairy. These activities and approaches mean that the BWL is now in a
   position to i) establish a new entity – the Bioregional Weaving Alliance – designed to
   support learning and initiatives leading to bioregional regeneration, restoration and
   protection, especially in the South East, and ii) offer a portfolio of emerging concepts for
   holistic investment.
   An emerging portfolio of regeneration projects
   The portfolio of concepts can be thought of as a collection of systemic innovations
   that together can trigger a bioregional transition to local regenerative economies as
   well as thriving landscapes and communities, in line with the manifesto and overall
   BWL mission. The portfolio was developed through residential and local workshops –
   including at the evocative localities of Dromana House on the Blackwater river and the
   Coastguard Cultural Centre overlooking Tramore Bay. A major conference was held
   to consider innovative landscape and community financing using the portfolio and the
   support platform of the BWL and its BWL catalyst funds as a case study.
   Currently the 10 concepts are in the process of being matured and developed to
   become fundable and investable as an integrated portfolio of critical interventions for
   the bioregion. The concepts are interdependent and entangled, and the local team
   believes that only when viewed as a whole can investment and finance flows expect to
   address unexpected externalities, risks beyond linear value chains, and the potential of
   holistic aggregated returns. The hope is that investment in such an emergent portfolio
   will catalyze large-scale positive change for communities and for the landscape – and
   generate inspiration, social, natural, and financial capital.
   Both the weaving team and local stakeholders are determined to find new ways of
   holistically financing the regeneration of their bioregion through a support structure
   and emergent portfolio that is built on local knowledge and bottom-up decision-making
   and inclusive, equitable governance structures.

3.3 Bioregional Hubs As early as 1983, legendary systems thinker Donella Meadows envisioned “[...] a number of centers where information and models about resources and the environment are housed.” She said, “There would need to be many of these centers, all over the world, each one responsible for a discrete bioregion. They would contain people with excellent minds and tools, but they would not be walled off, as scientific centers so often are, either from the lives of ordinary people or from the realities of political processes. The people in these centers would be at home with farmers, miners, planners, and heads of state and they would be able both to listen to, and talk to, all of them.” 117

Meadows was outlining the capabilities of an institution that would function as a place-based knowledge broker and capacity builder to catalyze collaborative action toward what we now call regenerative economies. She called these institutions Bioregional Learning Centers (BLCs). Today, there are dozens of such centers118 established around the world – like BLC South Devon, UK (see Case Study 3: The Bioregional Learning Center in South Devon) and BLC Barichara, Colombia. Organizers from around the world gather regularly to share insights and strategies from BLCs in digital learning forums like the Design School for Regenerating Earth’s ‘Birthing BLCs’ program. These centers typically focus on education, research, and skill-building related to the specific ecological, cultural, and social

They offer various programs, workshops, seminars, and                           community-led institution courses that focus on topics such as ecology, permaculture, sustainable living                          that functions as a gathering practices, Indigenous knowledge, and local history. The primary goal is to provide                      place (physical and/or virtual), opportunities for individuals and communities to deepen their understanding of                          resource center, and facilitator the unique characteristics and challenges of their bioregion, while equipping them                      of various regeneration-related

2. Listening, ongoing and comprehensive systems mapping & research
   Bioregional Hubs are well-positioned to organize listening sessions to tap into
   what regenerators want to focus on in the short, medium, and long-term. In
   many cases, this can and should be based upon positive regenerative land
   use activities already under way in the Bioregion. These activities are often
   underfunded, and may represent existing “shovel ready” projects. Additionally,
   Hubs can carry out ongoing, contextual systems mapping exercises to identify
   which systems the local community wants to work on shifting first, and map a
   strategy for doing so. Hubs can also conduct research programs informed by
   listening sessions and the systems mapping.119
3. Capacity building & upskilling
   New skills and capabilities will be required across sectors to mitigate the
   compounding effects of ecological collapse, and for the regenerative transition
   of economies and societies. Bioregional Hubs can provide the institutional
   framework for the necessary upskilling and capacity building. In addition,
   they can curate programming and education for community members of the
   bioregion as well, strengthening climate resilience and community weaving.120
   Bioregional Hubs can ensure that Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and                                                 Traditional Ecological

119 This mapping can highlight interdependencies between systems and can include an assessment of dynamics such
    as feedback loops, tipping points, and leverage points. 120 The hosting and facilitation of trainings and gatherings can be an important revenue stream for Bioregional Hubs.
    Bioregional hubs may also serve as a maker space or co-working space – other potential sources of revenue. 121 U.S. National Park Service: Traditional Ecological Knowledge 122 In Social Forestry: Tending the Land as a People of Place, Tomi Hazel Vaarde differentiates between TEK and
    Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK), with TEK being defined as “a collection of stories and procedures that
    holds wisdom and pertinence for Place-based culture.” Vaarde notes that “some TEK survives in epics that have
    been moved through migration, yet still contain resonance in a newly settled Place.” This differs from IEK which is
    based on an unbroken tradition of land stewardship held by a specific lineage of people in a particular place, usually
    involving regular ritual or ceremonial practices over millennia. In this book, we use the term ‘Indigenous wisdom’
    as a more general term that certainly includes IEK, but is not limited to the category of ecology. We suggest that a
    thorough understanding of the term IEK would not consider ecology as something separate from other aspects of
    existence, wisdom, or fields of study, however we use the more general term to limit the risk that readers confine their
    interpretation within a separate category, something the Western mind has been trained to do. 123 Practice of the R Values is critical here. (see Page 70) 124 The initial Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab is based at Deakin University, Australia. Dozens of additional Labs are

4. Identification and incubation/acceleration of regenerative business cases
   Being deeply embedded in a local bioregional context, Bioregional Hubs will
   play a critical role in both identifying and supporting regenerative business
   cases or projects that are aligned with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy.
   Both structured and needs-based programs can support the formation of
   regenerative projects and organizations, and incubate and accelerate them.
   Drawing on their embeddedness in communities and ecosystems, Bioregional
   Hubs will also play a critical role in organizing synergistic portfolios of existing
   and new projects and organizations that BFFs can then invest in. All of this,
   again, will be informed by the land use and systems mapping capabilities
   that Bioregional Hubs can provide. This function supports the development of
   approaches to catalyzing the economic transition.125
5. Transparent and real-time progress tracking & data collection
   Bioregional Hubs have the potential to aggregate Monitoring, Reporting, and                             Monitoring, Reporting, and
   Verification (MRV), by providing transparent, real-time progress tracking against                       Verification (MRV) – A process

6. Curating interfaces with global networks of Bioregional Hubs & Learning
   Centers
   As part of an international network, individual Bioregional Hubs can ensure
   that local experiences are shared beyond the boundaries of the bioregion,
   catalyzing action around the world. Simultaneously, Hubs can draw on the data,
   knowledge, and wisdom in the global network to inform ongoing regenerative
   action and, as a result, financial resource governance. Coordination between
   Hubs can help to establish and share frameworks, optimize operations, channel
   opportunities, and inform data assessment, best practices, and other activities.

    CASE STUDY 3:
    The Bioregional Learning Center in South Devon –
    Modeling Bioregional Hubs
    By Isabel Carlisle

    About Bioregional Learning Center South Devon
    Bioregional Learning Center South Devon was founded in 2017 by three designers,
    ecologists and climate activists as a systemic response to the systemic impacts
    of climate change. The Center works creatively and collaboratively in and at the
    intersections of economy, ecology, learning, arts and culture and the gaps in between.
    While the bioregion it covers is South Devon, its projects operate at scales that range

    from the whole of the South West, to Devon and down to the Dart catchment, or just a
    stretch of the river.
    Bringing a bioregion into being
    The Center’s aim is to create a resilient region that functions as a learning landscape
    by making collaboration possible and giving civil society a leading role alongside
    landowners, experts, NGOs, and policy-makers. Because it has received only a small
    amount of unrestricted core funding, the evolution of the Center has been mainly
    through funded projects in which it has honed its way of working. These projects
    represent the steps for bringing a bioregion into being, and are the core functions
    that any Bioregional Learning Center would need to perform.
1. Develop a story of place - This regenerative design process enabled the Center
    to understand the bioregion it serves, how it functions, and where its edges are. The
    character of a place is revealed by overlaying different lenses, all the way from deep
    geological time, through social and political history, to land use and human culture.
    The pattern that is revealed points to where the fuzzy boundaries of this island of
    coherence lie, and how it relates to its immediately surrounding places and the
    bigger region or nation. See: Story of Place for NW Plymouth.
2. Reveal the systems within the region - Humans have always lived in webs of
    life-support systems – both ecosystems and human systems – that meet humanity’s
    basic needs. Today these systems are typically managed by public utility companies
    and large-scale businesses, and regulated by local authorities and the state. By
    mapping for vitality in its bioregion, getting out on the land and meeting people, the
    Center organizing team developed an understanding of local systems and could
    determine how best to support and connect innovators. See: Learning Journey for
    Climate Resilience.
3. Intervene and demonstrate - Through leading or participating in projects in
    our bioregion Center members look for creative ways to intervene in systems
    such as the drinking water system. In a move towards common pool resource
    management126 they make sure to bring in the voice of civil society, as well as
    experts, using data, design, the arts, and dialogue to bridge the gap between
    academia, policy makers, and people on the ground. The Center acts as a trusted
    neutral player, with its learning center as a backbone organization. See: Voices of the
    Dart.
4. Launch a multi-sector design process - The Center grasped the opportunity to
    start a big region-wide conversation in establishing the Devon Doughnut Collective.
    Over a year of fortnightly Zoom meetings, the collective put together an ecological
    and economic assessment of Devon, with twin-track indicators and pathways to
    action for both policy-makers and civil society. The Center hosted the project as an
    action learning endeavor, bringing key change-makers from all sectors into the same
    space to create an interactive Doughnut, available on a dedicated website. See: The
    Devon Doughnut.
5. Widen reach and impact - The Center is currently embarking on the first steps
    to a climate adaptation strategy for the region, with funding from the regional
    government. In this first year, Center members plan to take elected councilors,
    government staff, community climate groups, and some members of the UK
    adaptation community of practice on a 5-day learning journey around the region,
    to widen the conversation, look at the risks and challenges, and visit the places

   and people already making strides towards adaptation. The second part of this
   programme will see the launch of a touring exhibition on climate challenges and
   adaptation. In future years the Center will set up demonstrator projects and a
   learning network for exchanging information locally. All of these activities aim to
   provide capacity building and the upskilling of relevant communities and actors.
6. Document and showcase your learning region - the center continually converts
   practice into resources to showcase the work, interpret it, and share it, as seen on
   the website. Center members act as ambassadors for the region on public platforms,
   and take part in international bioregional conversations. Data, measuring, and
   working with experts increasingly takes place in a ‘backroom’ for the bioregion, while
   polycentric governance grows out of building a network of generative relationships
   and trust.
   Growing a funding ecosystem
   BLC is now focusing on designing and prototyping a ‘funding ecosystem’ in South
   Devon that can build community and ecological wealth through a linked suite of
   philanthropic and investment vehicles that can be replicated elsewhere without the
   need for philanthropic funding. The outcome will not only be a quantifiable return on
   investment expressed through multiple value gain: the Bioregion is also being skilled
   up in climate literacy; enhancing the ability of citizens to collect, interpret and share
   data; and enabling their participation in the governance of the natural systems of the
   bioregion - water, soil, biodiversity, air, and marine habitats.
   The Bioregional funding eco-system will resource, through innovative financial
   instruments, projects that shift the needle on regenerating systems and the
   regeneration activators that are leading them. The Center is setting out to prove
   that there is cascading value, and a return on investment, from working in a joined-
   up bioregional way. The overall impact of all this interlocking action on a whole
   bioregion has not yet been modeled. Nor has it been placed into a landscape-wide
   climate adaptation and resilience plan. The Center believes that the time has come
   to do that and make the model publicly available as part of growing climate literacy.

Once a Bioregional Organizing Team (see Figure 7.) has brought together key bioregional actors to develop a Bioregional Regeneration Strategy as part of the Coinitiation & Co-creation phase (see Section 3.2), Bioregional Financing Facilities can be set up127 to fund and finance the realization of the vision laid out in the strategy.128 BFFs do this by working hand in hand with the Bioregional Organizing Team and Bioregional Hub to enable the decentralization of financial resource governance, the design of synergistic project portfolios, and the transition to a regenerative economy. Whereas Bioregional Hubs work to bring together and empower a bioregional regeneration network by facilitating regenerative flow of all capital types, BFFs focus specifically – but not exclusively – on facilitating the regenerative flow of financial capital. With this focus, and a staff with relevant expertise, BFFs can facilitate interaction with existing legal, economic, and political systems, and intermediate in ways that a Bioregional Organizing Team or Bioregional Hub may not be designed or resourced for.

127 Or evolved from existing, aligned institutions. 128 Please note (as stated in Section 3) that if a Bioregional Financing Facility is set up before the strategy is agreed upon,
   that it needs to be able to incorporate the strategy into its governance process once the strategy is created.
