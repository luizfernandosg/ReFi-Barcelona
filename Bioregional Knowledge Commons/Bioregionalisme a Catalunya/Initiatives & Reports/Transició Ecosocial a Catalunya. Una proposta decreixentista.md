### 1. Executive overview

Commissioned by the *Grup de Transició Ecosocial* of CGT‑Catalunya, the report **“Transició Ecosocial a Catalunya. Una proposta decreixentista”** charts a realist pathway to steer Catalonia away from an extractivist, fossil‑fuelled economy toward a territorially rooted, care‑centred and materially lighter society. It diagnoses the ecological poly‑crisis (climate, biodiversity, materials and social inequality) as a civilisational tipping point and argues that neither *business‑as‑usual* nor a techno‑optimistic Green New Deal can stay within planetary limits. The authors – **Luis González Reyes, Erika González Briz and Adrián Almazán** – weave biophysical analysis with labour, gender and justice perspectives to design a **sector‑by‑sector degrowth roadmap up to 2040**.&#x20;

### 2. Origins & stakeholders

* **Convenor:** CGT‑Catalunya’s Ecosocial Transition working group, backed by union resources and member expertise.
* **Research team:** González Reyes, González Briz & Almazán (Ecologistas en Acción & Universidad Autónoma de Madrid backgrounds).
* **Supporting crafts:** design by L’Apòstrof SCCL; printing by El Foli Verd SCCL.
* **Intended allies:** grassroots unions, municipalist networks, agro‑ecology and housing cooperatives, community energy initiatives and feminist care movements – all invited to co‑implement the roadmap.

---

### 3. Analytical foundations

**Metabolic & socio‑labour cartography.**

* Transport and industry devour 70 % of final energy, with oil still 46 % of the primary mix; renewables cover barely 5 % (2019).
* Material throughput is strongly net‑import dependent; domestic extraction supplies only one‑third of use (2020) and is dominated by construction minerals.
* Care work (largely unpaid and feminised) accounts for 53 % of all hours worked in Spain, revealing a hidden pillar of the economy.
  **Imminent limits.** Fossil peaks (oil 2018, diesel 2016) and critical mineral scarcity intersect with climate chaos and the sixth mass extinction, forcing rapid contraction of material and energy demand.

### 4. Roadmap – key topics & flagship measures

#### 4.1 Energia

*Shift from fossil/nuclear dependency (84 % of mix) to “R3E” – truly renewable, regenerative & emancipatory energies.*

* Drastic demand‑side reduction through four‑day week, sufficiency standards and territorial relocalisation.
* Community‑scale biomass, micro‑hydro, solar‑thermal and low‑tech wind built with abundant local materials.

#### 4.2 Materials i residus

*Build a circular‑by‑design economy anchored in reuse and right‑to‑repair.*

* Ban planned obsolescence; differential pricing to disincentivise luxury consumption; cooperative second‑hand networks like *Drapaires d’Emaús*.

#### 4.3 Restauració ecosistèmica – silvicultura

*Recover ecological functionality across 62 % forest cover and degraded watersheds.*

* Prioritise non‑intervention, dead‑wood generation and adaptive silviculture; create green corridors and coastal wetland buffers; robust fire‑management brigades.

#### 4.4 Alimentació i aigua

*Universalise agro‑ecology and shorten food chains.*

* Scale cooperative land trusts (*Fundació Emprius*) and logistics hubs; expand organic acreage beyond current 15 % and refocus on basic staples; regenerate soils and secure water via precision irrigation.

#### 4.5 Indústria

*Down‑shift heavy, export‑oriented manufacturing while safeguarding livelihoods.*

* Re‑tool towards maintenance, retrofit and renewable hardware; embed workers’ co‑determination; phase‑out petro‑chemical and automotive overcapacity.

#### 4.6 Transport

*Cut energy use by 60 % by 2035 through demand reduction and modal shift.*

* Moratorium on airport & motorway expansions; public freight rail spine; urban design for 15‑minute neighbourhoods; progressive fuel rationing.&#x20;

#### 4.7 Construcció i habitatge

*From property to *****************************************dret d’ús***************************************** (right‑to‑use) cooperatives and rural eco‑renovation.*

* Massive retrofit with bio‑based materials, green roofs, biodiversity features; convert urban asphalt to market gardens; mobilise vacant housing via occupation rights if necessary.

#### 4.8 Turisme

*Degrow an overtouristed sector (12 % GDP) to ecological and social carrying capacity.*

* Cap flights, phase out cruise industry, re‑orient labour to care and restoration sectors, promote slow regional tourism.

#### 4.9 Mineria

*Apply strict sufficiency criteria: extract only for renewable infrastructure and essential health uses.*

* Ban new open‑pit licences in biodiversity hotspots; enforce full ecological restoration bonds.

#### 4.10 Digitalització

*Tech sobriety for a low‑energy internet.*

* Extend device lifetime to 10 years, prioritise free/open networks (*GuifiNet* model), and audit cloud energy footprints.

### 5. Strategic levers

The roadmap culminates in **three intertwined action logics**: confront socio‑ecological degradation (union & community resistance); articulate ecosocial cultural frames (narratives of care, sufficiency, autonomy); and build communalisms (co‑managed commons that meet essential needs).

---

### 6. Implementation timeline & governance

* **2024‑25:** union‑led campaigns on toxic workplaces; pilot community energy and cooperative housing projects; legislative push for a four‑day week.
* **2026‑30:** phase‑out airport expansion, reach 95 % community‑energy coverage, cut material throughput 25 %.
* **By 2040:** Catalonia operates within planetary boundaries, with care, agro‑ecology and maintenance sectors absorbing labour transitioned from fossil‑dependent industries.

Monitoring is vested in annual citizen assemblies, with open data on energy, materials and wellbeing indicators.

### 7. Value for the Bioregional Knowledge Commons

This degrowth roadmap offers **transferable design principles**: biophysical accounting at regional scale; cross‑movement strategy rooted in labour and care; and modular sector plans that bioregions can adapt to their own resource endowments.
