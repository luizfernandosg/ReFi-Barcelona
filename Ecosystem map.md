# Ecosystem map - WIP


Information is the cornerstone of constructing the bridges we aspire to build. This [[ecosystem map]] is a dynamic resource, curated to illuminate the intricate network we are navigating with ReFi BCN. Our goal is to bring visibility, and hopefully support, to the thriving ecosystem of ReFi-aligned initiatives around Barcelona.

## Understanding ReFi-Aligned Projects

Before diving into our local and global landscapes, let's address a crucial question: What exactly are ReFi-aligned projects? The answer is not straightforward as these projects are diverse and subjective in nature. However, they share common threads of aligning with the principles of Regenerative Finance (ReFi). Here, we present a selection of initiatives we've encountered in Barcelona that have inspired us with their approach to sustainability, community empowerment, and innovation.

## Local Landscape: Barcelona and Catalonia

Barcelona, a vibrant hub of innovation and collaboration, presents a unique canvas for ReFi-aligned activities. We are diving into several key areas:

- [ ] **[[ReFi-aligned landscape of Barcelona]]**  
  Exploring Barcelona's initiatives and projects that align with ReFi principles, focusing on sustainable finance and community empowerment.

- [ ] **[[Social Economy in Barcelona and Catalonia]]**  
  Investigating the region's social economy sector, which includes cooperatives, mutuals, nonprofits, and social enterprises, and its interplay with ReFi models.

- [ ] **[[Cooperative landscape of Barcelona and Catalonia]]**  
  Mapping out the extensive network of cooperatives in Barcelona and Catalonia, understanding their contributions to local economies and social structures.

- [ ] **[[Barcelona and the Web3 Ecosystem]]**  
  Delving into how Barcelona is integrating into the Web3 landscape, with a focus on blockchain technologies and decentralized applications.

- [ ] **[[Barcelona and Participatory Technology]]**  
  Assessing how participatory technology tools are being utilized in Barcelona to foster community engagement and decentralized decision-making.

- [ ] **[[Barcelona and the Ecological Transition]]**  
  Examining Barcelona's strategies and initiatives towards ecological sustainability and how they intersect with ReFi principles.

## Global Context: ReFi and Web3

Beyond our local environment, we recognize the global nature of the ReFi and Web3 movements. We aim to connect with and learn from:

- [ ] **[[ReFi Ecosystem]]**  
  Understanding the global ReFi landscape, including key players, networks, and projects that are pioneering regenerative finance worldwide.

- [ ] **Web3 Funding Mechanisms**  
  Exploring innovative funding models in the Web3 space, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), grants, and community funding, which can support sustainable and regenerative projects.

## Collaboration and Open-Source Ethos

Our mission extends beyond local boundaries. We embrace an open-source ethos, believing that transparency and collaboration are paramount for collective growth and impact. This website and knowledge base are designed to be shared and adapted, inviting other local nodes and groups to engage with and expand upon our work.
