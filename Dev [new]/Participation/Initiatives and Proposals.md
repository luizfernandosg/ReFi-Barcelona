## Overview: Co-Creating ReFi BCN's Future

ReFi BCN thrives on the collective intelligence and creative energy of its members and community. This page outlines how anyone—from working members to casual participants—can propose initiatives, contribute to ongoing projects, and help shape the cooperative's direction.

Our initiatives process embodies the bridge-building nature of ReFi BCN itself: combining the transparent, participatory governance of cooperatives with the open innovation approach of Web3 communities. We aim to create a process that is both structured enough to ensure accountability and open enough to welcome diverse contributions.
