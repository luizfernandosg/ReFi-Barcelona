# BioFi Barcelona

*Finances Biorregionals: Com finançar la transformació del territori des de comunitats locals*

Event date: 26-27 May 2024 | Location: Bloc4BCN, Barcelona

## About the Event

[Event Information and Overview](BioFi_Barcelona_Flyer.md)

BioFi Barcelona explores bioregional finance mechanisms to support local regenerative projects and connect global funding with territorial intelligence. This two-day event organized by Commons Agency and ReFi Barcelona introduces the concept of Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFFs) in the Catalan context.

## The Ecological Crisis and the Need for Bioregional Finance

We find ourselves at a critical turning point for Earth and the financial sector. The planet faces multiple interconnected ecological crises—climate change, biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation—that form a "polycrisis" with cascading effects across social, economic, and political systems. The current financial system, designed to serve colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism, has produced a massive concentration of resources tied to extractive activities destroying the possibility for life on Earth to continue to thrive.

An effective and proportionate response requires urgent, large-scale regeneration of the biosphere rooted in ecological integrity, cultural revitalization, the centering of Indigenous wisdom, and recognition of our planetary interdependence. Rather than merely closing the "nature finance gap" with conventional approaches, we need a fundamental transformation of how financial resources are governed and allocated.

## Bioregionalism: Harnessing the Intelligence of Place

Bioregionalism offers a promising framework for this transformation, focusing on:

- Understanding regions based on ecological and cultural features rather than political boundaries
- Honoring the unique ecological and cultural intelligence of place
- Building financial systems that respect natural boundaries and flows
- Recognizing local communities as essential stewards and knowledge-holders

This place-based approach creates the foundation for sustainable and regenerative economic systems that work with, rather than against, natural processes. Cases like Salmon Nation demonstrate how bioregional thinking can reimagine relationships between people, place, and economic systems.

## Bioregional Financing Facilities: Connecting Resources and Regeneration

Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFFs) serve as the connective tissue between financial resources and local regenerative activities. These decentralized structures organize project portfolios for systemic change while enabling capital to reach the people and initiatives best positioned to contribute to global regeneration.

### Four Types of Bioregional Financing Facilities

1. **Regional Development Financial Institutions**: Provide loans, grants, and investments to support bioregional regeneration
2. **Revolving Funds**: Create self-replenishing pools of capital for specific regenerative purposes
3. **Participatory Grantmaking**: Enable communities to collectively decide how financial resources are allocated
4. **Dedicated Bioregional Asset Managers**: Manage investments with both financial returns and regenerative impacts

## Creating an Enabling Environment

Effective BFFs require supportive organizational infrastructure. Bioregional regeneration typically progresses through distinct phases:

1. Initial organizing and relationship building
2. Collective visioning and planning
3. Implementation and project development
4. Scaling and systemic integration

**Bioregional Hubs** serve as critical coordination centers, bringing together diverse stakeholders and providing the collaborative infrastructure needed for successful BFFs. Examples like The Bioregional Learning Centre in South Devon and The Bioregional Weaving Lab in South East Ireland demonstrate effective approaches to bioregional organizing.

## Governance and Capital Allocation

BFF governance must be fundamentally aligned with regenerative values:

- **Values-based approaches**: Embedding core values in governance structures and processes
- **Inclusive participation**: Thoughtfully structured stakeholder engagement
- **Appropriate frameworks and tools**: Effective decision-making processes and accountability mechanisms
- **Addressing power imbalances**: Governance structures that promote equity
- **Working with existing authorities**: Navigating relationships with government and traditional entities
- **Inter-regional coordination**: Building right relationship with other BFFs across regions and scales

## Innovative Financing Mechanisms

BFFs can employ numerous innovative approaches to financing bioregional regeneration:

- **Web3-based eco-credits and DAOs**: Leveraging blockchain technology for transparent and decentralized finance
- **Digital nature-based currencies**: Creating currencies backed by ecological values
- **Local market networks and bioregional vouchers**: Strengthening local exchange systems
- **Participatory grantmaking**: Democratizing capital allocation through approaches like quadratic voting
- **Retroactive Public Goods Funding**: Rewarding already-completed regenerative work
- **Mutual credit systems**: Enhancing capital efficiency through obligation clearing

These mechanisms represent a toolkit for bioregional financing that can be adapted to local contexts and needs.

## Case Studies: Learning from Experience

Real-world examples demonstrate the practical application of bioregional finance concepts:

- **The Edge Prize**: Supporting and connecting regenerative innovators
- **Regenerate Cascadia**: Coordinated bioregional organizing
- **Hylo**: Digital platform enabling bioregional coordination
- **ReCommon**: Regenerative common land trusts
- **Regenerosity**: Trust-based philanthropic model for grassroots regeneration
- **Regen Network**: Developing ecological assets and credit systems
- **Golden Bay and the Wellbeing Protocol**: Participatory approaches to resource allocation

These cases show how different approaches work in varied contexts while revealing common patterns and principles across successful initiatives.

## The Catalan Context

*This section will contain resources about the local context in Catalunya and how BioFi principles can be applied to local regenerative initiatives.*

Catalunya represents a unique bioregion with distinct ecological features, cultural identity, and economic systems. The BioFi Barcelona event explores how bioregional financing approaches can be tailored to this specific context:

- How can Catalunya's strong cooperative tradition inform BFF development?
- What existing regional financial institutions could evolve into BFFs?
- How might bioregional boundaries be defined within the Catalan context?
- What regenerative activities are most needed and promising in this bioregion?

## Next Steps and Call to Action

Building bioregional finance requires collective action across sectors:

- **Financial Institutions**: Incorporate bioregional thinking into investment strategies
- **Policymakers**: Develop enabling policy frameworks
- **Philanthropic Organizations**: Provide catalytic capital and support capacity building
- **Bioregional Organizations**: Strengthen bioregional organizing and relationships
- **Researchers**: Investigate priority areas in bioregional finance
- **Technology Developers**: Create tools and platforms for bioregional coordination

Together, we can transform our financial systems to support thriving bioregions and a regenerative future.
