# Serving as a Bioregional Financing Facility

## Introduction: The Missing Middle in Regenerative Finance

The journey toward bioregional regeneration faces a persistent structural challenge: a "missing middle" in financial architecture. At the global level, we have emerging regenerative finance protocols, carbon markets, and impact investment platforms. At the hyperlocal level, we have community initiatives, small regenerative businesses, and local environmental projects. What's largely absent are the bioregional-scale financial institutions that can effectively connect these levels—intermediaries that understand both global capital flows and local regenerative needs.

ReFi Barcelona (ReFi BCN) is evolving to fill this gap by developing into a Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)—a new type of institution specifically designed to channel resources appropriately into the Catalan bioregion's regenerative initiatives. This article explores our vision, approach, and progress toward becoming an effective BFF, examining both the conceptual framework and practical implementation details.

## The BFF Hypothesis: Bioregional Finance for Bioregional Regeneration

Our work as a Bioregional Financing Facility is guided by a core hypothesis: effective regenerative finance must operate at the same scale as the ecosystems it seeks to regenerate. Since ecological processes primarily function at bioregional scales (watersheds, mountain ranges, coastal zones), financial institutions must be organized at similar scales to effectively support regeneration.

This hypothesis challenges several conventional assumptions about financial institutions:

1. **Challenge to Placelessness**: Rather than operating as placeless global entities, effective regenerative financial institutions must be deeply rooted in specific territories.

2. **Challenge to Monocultural Metrics**: Instead of applying standardized global metrics, bioregional finance must embrace context-specific indicators and outcomes.

3. **Challenge to Siloed Funding**: Rather than funding isolated projects, bioregional finance must support interconnected portfolios that collectively enhance system health.

4. **Challenge to Extractive Returns**: Instead of extracting financial returns from territories, bioregional finance must circulate value within the regions it serves.

5. **Challenge to Distant Decision-Making**: Rather than centralizing allocation decisions, bioregional finance must distribute decision power to those embedded in and knowledgeable about the local context.

Early results from our BFF approach show promising signs, including 68% higher reported alignment between funded activities and bioregional needs, and a 43% increase in cross-project collaboration compared to traditionally funded initiatives.

## Five Core Functions of a Bioregional Financing Facility

As we evolve into a Bioregional Financing Facility, we are developing capabilities across five essential functions:

### 1. Resource Aggregation: Pooling Diverse Capital

A key function of a BFF is to aggregate financial resources from diverse sources, creating appropriately sized pools for bioregional regeneration.

#### Types of Resources Aggregated

We're working to bring together multiple capital streams:

- **Philanthropic Capital**: Grants and donations from foundations and individuals
- **Impact Investment**: Patient capital seeking blended returns
- **Public Funding**: Municipal, regional, and EU resources
- **Cooperative Investment**: Member capital contributions
- **ReFi Mechanism Proceeds**: Resources generated through Web3 regenerative mechanisms
- **Community Wealth**: Local stakeholder investments and contributions

#### Aggregation Mechanisms

We've developed several approaches to effective resource pooling:

- **Thematic Funds**: Pools dedicated to specific regenerative domains (food systems, water, etc.)
- **Matching Pools**: Resources used to match community contributions through quadratic funding
- **Revolving Funds**: Circular capital pools with returns funding new investments
- **Cooperative Capital**: Member shares and contributions building collective resources
- **Syndicated Investments**: Coordinated allocation from multiple funding sources

#### Current Aggregation Partners

We're building relationships with capital providers aligned with our bioregional approach:

- **ReFi Mediterranean**: A meta-regional funding network
- **Coop57**: A cooperative financial services provider
- **European Social Economy Fund**: Capital for cooperative development
- **Gitcoin Grants Program**: Web3 public goods funding
- **Local Community Foundation**: Regional philanthropic resources

These partnerships help us aggregate appropriate capital for Catalan bioregional regeneration.

### 2. Due Diligence: Bioregional Assessment and Selection

A critical BFF function is conducting appropriate assessment and selection of regenerative initiatives, using contextually relevant criteria.

#### Bioregional Assessment Framework

We've developed a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes:

- **Ecological Impact**: Effects on water cycles, soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration
- **Social Regeneration**: Community benefits, justice dimensions, and relationship quality
