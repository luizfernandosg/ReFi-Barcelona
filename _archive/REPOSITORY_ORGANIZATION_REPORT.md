# ReFi Barcelona Repository Organization Report

## Executive Summary

The ReFi Barcelona repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for the ReFi Barcelona cooperative, documenting their mission to bridge regenerative finance with local bioregional initiatives in Catalonia. The repository contains substantial content across multiple domains but would benefit from structural reorganization to improve accessibility and maintenance.

## Repository Overview

### Mission & Vision
ReFi Barcelona is a cooperative local node of ReFi DAO, focused on:
- Building bridges between global ReFi movement and local Barcelona/Catalonia context
- Integrating regenerative finance principles with bioregional approaches
- Creating connections between Web3/DeFi innovations and traditional cooperative structures
- Supporting ecosocial transition through financial mechanisms

### Core Strategic Framework
1. **Bioregional Approach**: Organizing around Catalonia as a bioregion
2. **Cooperative Structure**: Operating as a multi-stakeholder cooperative (SCCL)
3. **Hybrid Model**: Bridging Web3/DAO mechanisms with traditional cooperative governance
4. **Ecosystem Integration**: Connecting urban innovation with rural regeneration

## User Experience Analysis

### Current Navigation Challenges
1. **Multiple Entry Points**: Unclear whether to start with `Home.md`, `README.md`, or `ReFi Barcelona/`
2. **Content Scattering**: Related topics spread across multiple directories
3. **Inconsistent Naming**: Mixed naming conventions across directories
4. **Hidden Depth**: Rich content not easily discoverable

### Target User Journeys
