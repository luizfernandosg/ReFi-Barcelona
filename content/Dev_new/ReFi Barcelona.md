# ReFi Barcelona

## **A Local Node as a Rooted Cooperative 🌱**

**ReFi Barcelona** is a local node within the global [[ReFi Ecosystem]], focused on connecting **regenerative finance, local regenerators and the Social & Solidarity Economy (ESS)** in Barcelona and across Catalonia - to drive forward the so called [[Ecosocial Transition]].

We're also part of a broader bioregional effort through [[ReFi Mediterranean]], where we collaborate with other nodes across the bioregion to scale regenerative strategies and funding mechanisms for regenerative work.

> We serve as a bridge between global Web3 infrastructure and place-based economic transformation.

### **Our Approach: Building Hybrid Systems Through Cooperative Structures 🌍**

ReFi Barcelona is a **proof of concept** for building regenerative systems that are both **technologically innovative and socially grounded**.

We believe that to regenerate economies, we need **hybrid infrastructures** that:

- **Leverage Web3** for transparency, coordination, and composability; as well as for opening opportunities for funding and support
- **Integrate cooperative models** for human-scale governance and economic justice
- **Learn from local territories**, while staying globally connected

### **Our plan: Growing from the roots of cooperativism 🌲**

To build systems that work beyond theory, we need **real-world grounding**.

That's why ReFi BCN is based at [**Bloc4**](https://bloc4.coop/), Europe's largest cooperative innovation hub — home to more than 40 cooperatives and social enterprises. Bloc4 provides:

- Access to **funding channels beyond Web3** (public & cooperative finance)
- **Mentorship and training** in governance, sustainability and viability
- Daily exposure to the **needs, tools and culture** of ESS actors
- Incubation from Bloc4/Coòpolis, Barcelona's cooperative development agency

> Bloc4 amplifies our ability to design, test and share hybrid regenerative models with the local Social & Solidarity Economy.

## **The strategic lines we are building 🎍**

We've identified the following key strategic lines of work to support the work of local regenerators. These pillars guide our activities and shape our approach to supporting the ecosocial transition.

Our strategic lines are designed as a progression, from building awareness to enabling action:

1. **📚 Knowledge, Research & Education** — *From unawareness to understanding*
    
    We develop open knowledge and its repositories, materials, and practical guides that make regenerative concepts accessible to diverse audiences, with special attention to connecting global ReFi innovations with local contexts and needs, and vice versa.
    
    - [[Ecosystem Map]]
2. **👥 Community & Network** — *From understanding to collaboration*
    
    We organize events and spaces for connection, dialogue, and mutual learning between local and global actors.
    
    - ReFi Unconference Barcelona '24
    - BioFi Barcelona '25
3. **♻️ Financial Resources** — *From collaboration to supporting tangible impact*
    
    We aim to help local projects access regenerative funding through Web3 platforms and ethical banking in the Social & Solidarity economy, exploring how to create hybrid financial structures to support the much-needed regenerative work on the ground.
    
    - Piloting with the ReFi Mediterranean GG23 round
4. **⚖️ Governance & Innovation** — *From consolidation to systemic transformation (future)*
    
    On the horizon, we'd like to promote governance approaches that combine cooperative principles with DAOs, exploring different models to fund and develop local communities—such as democratic decision-making, established financial flows, quadratic funding, community currencies, and more. This pillar will activate in a future phase as the network strengthens.

We've created a comprehensive research resource that maps value-aligned actors across Barcelona and Catalonia, with specific focus on:

- Social & Solidarity Economy organizations
- Web3 and ReFi projects
- Regenerative practitioners and initiatives

The knowledge base serves as a foundation for our work by documenting the existing ecosystem and identifying potential bridges between communities.

> This knowledge base is a living research tool — not just for us, but for any one to explore, expand and build upon.
