BFFs do this by working hand in hand with the Bioregional Organizing Team and
Bioregional Hub to enable the decentralization of financial resource governance,
the design of synergistic project portfolios, and the transition to a regenerative
economy. Whereas Bioregional Hubs work to bring together and empower a
bioregional regeneration network by facilitating regenerative flow of all capital
types, BFFs focus specifically – but not exclusively – on facilitating the regenerative
flow of financial capital. Together, the Bioregional Organizing Team, Bioregional Hub,
and BFFs form the three legs of a stool that supports bioregional regeneration.9

rather than more, dependent on both financial capital overall and financial capital
from outside the region, and where financial flows better align with real flows of
value. BFFs will work on creating regenerative flows at multiple levels – at the
level of organizations it invests in, and at various levels in nested systems. This
includes supporting regenerative organizations in the bioregion with technical
assistance, and the development of the enabling environment conditions needed
for regenerative organizations to succeed; deepening and expanding markets
for regenerative activities; creating regenerating pools of funding to support
management of common assets; raising the right type of investment capital;

as an evolution of impact investing. They seek to establish a financial architecture
that recognizes the complexity inherent to systemic transformation, and the
fundamental interconnectedness of interventions. They help to build synergistic
and systemic investment portfolios, creating positive spillover values which enable
mutually reinforcing and positive feedback loops of systemic value generation
across projects.

BFFs provide a pathway for even multinational corporations – that often seem to
operate everywhere and nowhere at the same time – to come back into relationship
with the very real places and people they are dependent on and are in turn
impacting. BFFs enable them to move towards healing and reciprocity through how
they invest.

rather than more dependent on financial capital overall and financial capital from
outside the region, and where financial flows better align with real flows of value.
However, this aim of localizing and diversifying capital flow must be navigated
carefully within the global historical context in which centuries of colonialism and
neocolonialism have extracted diverse forms of wealth from certain bioregions
and transferred it to others. In places that have grown rich from this extraction, not
only will capital diversification be made easier by the excess material and financial
capital present, but capital localization efforts made without sincere engagement in
decolonial processes of reconciliation, reparation, and healing are likely to further
deepen inequality and injustice. In extracted contexts, the need for outside financial
capital may be more pressing, and the regenerative impact of financial capital may
be greater. Thus, BFFs may offer appropriate infrastructure for forming relationships
of solidarity, rebalancing, and reciprocity between diverse regions with shared
history.130 For example, BFFs might enable Indigenous communities to receive and
manage Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) from Global North countries to
support Indigenous stewardship and the realization of the targets set in the Global

Regeneration Strategy, their structures will vary. Diverse, decentralized
organizations can support increased systemic resilience, and improve the
effectiveness of BFFs as connective tissue.135 Therefore, we do not seek to be overly
prescriptive on how BFFs should be designed. Instead we lay out twelve high-level
attributes our research tells us each facility should work towards, and eventually
meet in order to effectively support the realization of the BFF objectives. We then
introduce templates for BFFs that can serve as a starting place in design.

1. Aim to align with living systems principles and Indigenous wisdom – BFFs
 are not meant to be designed as machines to be used for moving money
 between investors and regenerative activities; they are themselves meant to
 serve as regenerative activity. This is a purpose inseparable from the objective
 of catalyzing regenerative economies; thus BFFs should work to embody living
 systems patterns and principles136 in their organizational design and culture.
 The BFF, its relationships, the organizations it invests in, the local economy, the
 global economy, and the broader social and Earth systems they are nested R Values – Jan Hania

 makes BFFs unique, in that it focuses their capital on large-scale ecological and
 social regeneration and the realization of cascading benefits through systems
 change. In practice, this means that BFFs will need to prioritize bioregional
 regeneration activities and objectives in order to identify which BFFs to set
 up and in what sequence. From there, the strategy of each BFF should be
 crafted, with both the short and long term aspects of the broader Strategy as
 its objectives. BFFs can create tests to determine whether a given investment
 supports the transition to the regenerative economy,139 including healing and
 reconciliation, or whether it is further entrenching the economy of the bioregion
 in increasingly fragile global supply chains and systems built on extraction and
 destruction.

3. Implement an inclusive and participatory governance structure that
 represents the bioregion – It is critical that each BFF has a governance
 structure that is broadly representative of and based on the input of the people
 living and working in the bioregion, the people that have historically stewarded
 land in the bioregion if they have been misplaced, and the more than human life
 in that place. This structure should include management, a board, an investment
 committee, and participatory processes that feed into its decisions and
 operations. The role of the Bioregional Organizing Team to organize and activate
 key bioregional actors is important. Through this trust-building process, the early
 scaffolding of contextually-sound governance structures and practices can be
 built, and appropriate bioregional representatives to serve in BFF governance
 can be identified. The board should be ethnically and culturally representative
 of bioregional residents and their interests. BFFs should pay special attention to
 ensure Indigenous groups and communities that have faced structural violence
 and exploitation are represented in the places where they reside. We also
 recommend the inclusion of more than human life on BFF boards140 to ensure
 that the financial capital raised is not used to narrowly serve human interests,
 but is allocated to benefit all of the life in the bioregion. Additionally, a process
 should be established to have regular input from both youth and elders. We also
 recommend that governance boards rotate periodically in order to bring new
 energy and ideas to BFFs. A bioregion may decide to hold a town hall, citizens
 assembly, or election to select board members at regular intervals (more about
 governance in Section 4.5).

4. Work to shift power imbalances – By serving as connective tissue, Bioregional
 Financing Facilities help address the power imbalances often inherent in funder-
 fundee or investor-investee relationships. BFFs should work to address the
 power imbalance between those controlling large amounts of financial capital
 today and those struggling to resource the implementation of their regenerative
 projects. This includes imbalances across bioregions, such as those in places
 that have grown materially rich from colonial extraction and those in places
 that have been extracted from. It also includes imbalances within bioregions,
 such as those created by economic, racial, religious, and gender discrimination
 and violence. The transition to a regenerative economy should lead to a more
 equitable society where well being for all is prioritized.

139 Based on the bioregion’s vision for the regenerative economy.
140 The rights of nature movement has made progress, particularly since the inclusion of nature’s rights in Ecuador's
 revised constitution (ratified in 2008), to gain legal recognition of the rights of life other than humans to exist. The Earth
 Law Center, in particular, has been working to elect oceans, rivers, animals, etc. to corporate boards. These entities
 are represented by a human proxy that votes on their behalf.

 BFFs are designed to empower local land, water, and neighborhood stewards
 to implement the strategies they believe are most effective in their place –
 recognizing the value of local knowledge in delivering the 4 Returns. One
 practical way they do this is by working together with Bioregional Hubs to
 reduce the burden of applying for grants or securing investment capital, and
 the reporting requirements that come if a project or organization is successful
 in raising capital. Additionally, BFFs can support a shift in the power imbalance
 between humans and the more-than-human world, and promote greater
 harmony in the relationships between all life on the planet. At every level, BFFs
 should work towards restoring ‘right relationship’ – rooted in the principles of
 reciprocity and mutualism found in both biology and Indigenous wisdom.141

 sum through many small donations or eco-credit purchases, and local capital to
 mobilize capital from outside of the bioregion.144 BFFs aim to (i) rapidly scale up
 the amount of financial capital flowing to bioregional regeneration; (ii) diversify
 the types of capital used to meet varied financing needs and risk profiles, in an
 integrated capital structure; and (iii) strengthen local value flows. The primary
 objective of the integrated capital structure is not to guarantee investor returns,
 for which blended finance transactions are often criticized, but to strategically
 de-risk, change risk perception, fund synergistic portfolios of projects to drive
 systems change, fund common assets, and stimulate and build markets aligned
 with regeneration.

 capital to portfolios of smaller, high impact, synergistic projects driving systems
 change, increasingly referred to as ‘systemic investing’,145 and to do so at
 target geographies, benefitting from both diversification and the 4 Returns
 these portfolios will achieve. For investors or companies that want to support
 innovation, the Venture Studio (more details in Section 4.2) can provide
 exposure to innovation from the edges of the system and from the resurgence
 of Indigenous knowledge systems – both of which will be critical in building
 resilience in the years to come.

 Potential motivations for investing in bioregional action for philanthropists,
 investors, corporations, governments, or citizens are wide-ranging (and
 are explored in detail in Section 4.3). BFFs enable capital holders to invest
 collaboratively with like-minded funders and financiers. These facilities are
 designed to support and strengthen relationships, including among funders
 and financiers and between funders and financiers and the people, places,
 and changes unfolding in the bioregion. BFFs aim to ensure high levels of
 credibility and to speak the language of finance in order to establish a solid base
 of investor confidence. By bridging community-led governance together with
 current financial industry standards, these facilities also function as important
 interfaces between local initiatives and external investment – for example, from
 global capital markets – catalyzing their co-evolution.

7. Treat growth and returns as a means, not an end – The cycles of growth
 and decay are integral to living systems. BFFs are designed to support the
 transition to a regenerative economy that is rooted in this natural law, and does
 not mistake growth and returns for ends in themselves. There can be no infinite
 growth of a material system within a closed environment of finite materials
 without bringing about its collapse.146 To this end, BFFs recognize that growth
 should not be the purpose of a healthy economy or organization and financial
 returns cannot be the purpose of an investment.147 Financial models, term
 sheets, risk assessment approaches, and broader economic transition plans
 should reflect holistic objectives, deriving from the Bioregional Regeneration
 Strategy and the goals of regenerative organizations. When determining what

144 Demonstrating that local investors with a deeper understanding of bioregional dynamics and influence in the
 bioregion can help to reduce perceived risk by external investors and enable them to co-invest.
145 See the work of the TransCap Initiative.
146 It should be noted that economic growth is the driving force behind the economic policies of most nation states
 on Earth, and in 2020, Helmut Haberl et al concluded in A systematic review of the evidence on decoupling of GDP,
 resource use and GHG emissions, part II: synthesizing the insights, that “large rapid absolute reductions of resource
 use and GHG emissions cannot be achieved through observed decoupling rates."
147 Returns and liquidity can still act as a constraint for investment (inspired by work of the Capital Institute).

 level of returns an ecosystem and the people stewarding it can healthfully
 produce, we recommend BFF leadership apply the principle of the Honorable
 Harvest148 in their local social, economic, and ecological context.

 “Collectively, the Indigenous canon of principles and
 practices that govern the exchange of life for life is
 known as the Honorable Harvest. They are rules of sorts
 that govern our taking, shape our relationships with the
 natural world, and rein in our tendency to consume – that
 the world might be as rich for the seventh generation as it
 is for our own.”
 – Robin Wall-Kimmerer

8. Raise from purpose-aligned funders or investors – It will be important to attract
 capital providers of all types who believe in the importance of realizing the
 Bioregional Regeneration Strategy and are willing to try new, more relational
 models for assessing and mitigating risk149 – such as social credit scores, trust
 circles, aggregation, and integrated MRV.150 Many bioregions have socio-
 economic conditions that limit access to capital for certain communities based
 on conventional systems of assessing and mitigating risk.151 BFFs should seek
 to engage with capital providers who wish to support the decentralization of
 financial resource governance and the economic transition of the bioregion, and
 are interested in all 4 Returns. Potential motivations and incentives for various
 categories of capital providers are laid out in Section 4.3. The realization of
 bioregional regeneration strategies and success of regenerative organizations
 will depend upon the flexibility offered by purpose-aligned funders to address
 the specific barriers to deploying capital within each bioregion and the
 communities of which they are woven. Growing or deepening the relationship of
 funders and investors with the bioregion will be key to developing alignment.

 will bundle a range of projects and organizations in investment portfolios
 for systemic change to facilitate streamlined access to investment for small
 bioregional initiatives, and present an attractive proposition to major funders
 and investors seeking diversified, impactful, and aligned portfolios focused on
 bridge the systemic gap between the modest financing demands of individual
 projects and the substantial capital required for meaningful impact at scale. The
 aggregation and matchmaking function also importantly reduces the burden
 on projects and organizations to engage with the bureaucracy inherent in
 government, philanthropy, and impact investment, associated with accessing

148 More about this in Robin Wall Kimmerer’s book Braiding Sweetgrass.
149 The efficacy of such models has been demonstrated in microlending by the Grameen Bank, BRAC, etc. Additionally
 there are interesting pilots taking place using social risk metrics to finance on-reservation Native American housing in
 the US (Flower Hill Institute).
150 Such aligned capital providers may initially account for a small percentage of capital pools, but the push of
 global efforts to stabilize planetary systems and the pull of BFFs establishing strong track records of bioregional
 regeneration should increase this percentage rapidly by the late 2020s. In addition, significant pools of purpose-
 aligned funding should become available through forthcoming loss and damage and reparations payments.
151 In Indian Country in the US, for example, some of the factors contributing to this risk perception include: tribal
 sovereign powers, inalienability of tribal land, lack of trust and historically poor relationships with colonial financial
 institutions (credit to Atherton Phleger, Flower Hill Institute).
152 When developing portfolios for impact investors, BFFs can focus on a specific asset class to fit into the investor’s
 capital allocation framework.

 capital and reporting on its use. In their role as connective tissue , BFFs are able
 to interface with projects and capital providers, speaking the language of both,
 and meeting the needs of each to help bring them together.
 Due to the unique role networks of local support can play in the success of
 these projects, BFFs may also assist in advancing alternative forms of project
 selection and underwriting.

10. Apply an integrated approach to sensing and MRV – BFFs should develop
 MRV strategies that leverage modern technology and Traditional Ecological
 Knowledge (TEK)153 and Indigenous wisdom, quantitative and qualitative
 data, and sophisticated modeling and on-the-ground verification by citizen
 scientists.154 Together with Bioregional Hubs, there is potential for BFFs in a
 bioregion to develop a comprehensive MRV strategy and to share the overhead
 cost of a platform to host this information.155 This platform should include
 project or site-specific data and overall bioregional health data to effectively
 enable tracking of the systemic impact of investments. The platform should be
 managed as a commons and can enable accountability beyond just the projects
 BFFs invest in. Technologies such as eDNA analysis, bioacoustics, remote
 sensing, and life-centered AI156 can support improved sensing, which can
 serve BFFs and bioregional citizens in better sensemaking when applied in an
 integrated framework with TEK, Indigenous wisdom, and citizen science.

 There are several ecological MRV platforms available that bring many datasets
 into one place, that a bioregion might opt to use, together with bottom-up
 metrics.157 Building on attributes 7 and 9, an important efficiency of BFFs is that
 they aggregate MRV, reducing the burden of reporting and due diligence on
 individual projects and investors. These tools have the ability to meet on-the-
 ground projects where they are—through workflows, automation, and locally
 designed interfaces that interoperate with existing tools. This, combined with
 their ease of use, can play a critical transitional role in meeting legacy reporting
 requirements while supporting the emergence of self-determined practices,
 processes, and outcomes.158 These bioregional MRV or sensing platforms can
 leverage the falling costs of sensing technologies159 and become embodied
 intelligence systems, as laid out in Bruno Latour’s article, Gaia 2.0. In addition to
 supporting community members in their ongoing sensemaking and reducing
 external reporting burdens, community-centered MRV tools and resources,
 such as those offered through Open Future Coalition’s Open Impact platform,
 provide pathways to generating local economic returns through training and
 compensation for peer-to-peer impact validation.

153 See differentiation between TEK, Indigenous Ecological Knowledge,and Indigenous wisdom in section 3 (Vaarde
 2023).
154 Examples of direct compensation mechanisms for Indigenous communities for species monitoring/tracking include
 Biocultural Jaguar Credits issued on Regen Registry and the Biodiversity Credits issued by Savimbo.
155 An entity like the developing Nature Tech Collective could possibly support BFFs in this area.
156 Active Inference technology might be particularly relevant here since it is based on the cognitive processes of
 humans and other species, embedded in particular geospatial settings, and inherently trackable and traceable
 (Designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles, Karl Friston et al.) . The essay The Gaia Attractor by Rafael
 Kaufmann proposes a planetary AI co-pilot network to address the metacrisis. James Lovelock proposed something
 similar in his last book, Novacene, while Timothy M. Lenton and Bruno Latour’s influential article Gaia 2.0 suggested
 that humans could add some level of self-awareness to Earth’s self-regulation (Science, 2018).
157 The Nature Tech Collective has published a Nature FinTech Sector Map that maps organizations with offerings in the
 following areas: monetization, modeling, and measurement and monitoring.
158 Informed by Open Future Coalition’s experience working with grassroots impact efforts globally to reduce the burden
 of existing reporting requirements while bridging towards community-driven quantitative and qualitative metrics.
159 For example, we have access to higher resolution, more up to date remote sensing data than ever before. The launch
 costs for satellites have fallen 95 percent (with another massive reduction expected in the coming years) thanks to
 reuse, improved engineering, and increased volumes.

11. Invest in storytelling160 – Putting finance in service to life requires new,
 compelling stories of value, identity, and place. Extractive finance is built upon
 millenia of stories that are deeply embedded in our culture.161 Both new and
 ancient stories are essential when we are reassessing what we value and
 reorienting our culture and resources toward that. For people on the ground,
 the practicalities, benefits, and beauty of a thriving bioregion can be directly
 experienced. However, when communicating both the tangible local impact
 (e.g. the 4 Returns162) and the more intangible global effects of a distributed
 bioregional movement to non-local investors, robust storytelling is needed.
 BFFs can treat investment as a form of storytelling itself: breathing life into
 stories of action waiting to be told. BFFs can act with the understanding that the
 ways investments are rationalized, structured, and accounted for tell additional
 stories. Through capital raising, capital allocation, and broader marketing and
 communications, it is critical that BFFs nurture and enhance the foundation of
 stories around bioregional history, identity, and shared vision told and developed
 during the initial phases of bioregional organizing (see Section 3). Lastly, BFFs
 can invest in catalytic art and storytelling that enables the scaling of a grassroots
 movement and an economic transition that is only possible through inspiration.

 “The role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible.”
 – Toni Cade Bambara

12. Engage in partnerships, place-based citizen-stewardship, and the
 community of practice – BFFs are embedded in place and in local partnerships.
 To achieve their objectives, BFFs must be built on a strong relational foundation.
 They are set up by the people of a particular place to serve the vision of the
 Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. While they will have their own governance
 boards, management, and investment committees, the facilities should have
 close relationships and overlap with Bioregional Organizing Teams and
 Bioregional Hubs. Regular meetings between entities and ongoing, live feedback
 are important to ensure the success of the co-evolution process laid out in Table
 4. The shared MRV platform can support cooperative sensing and sensemaking
 among these actors. There is potential for a range of MRV-related partnerships
 including with Indigenous communities, academia, companies, NGOs

shares in the businesses they incubate and launch, the Bioregional Venture Studio
may additionally or alternatively be funded with grants. These grants might come
from the private sector in exchange for access to dealflow, or more traditional
philanthropic or government sources.

Once the bioregion reaches a more advanced stage of organizing, activation, and
strategy, where markets for regeneration are forming and projects and businesses
are ready to take investment, the Bioregional Organizing Team or Bioregional Trust
governance team can help to launch a Bioregional Investment Company. This
facility develops Systemic Investment Funds and Bioregional Regeneration Bonds,
which help to scale up the financing of synergistic portfolios of projects (see Section
4.4) through aggregation and matchmaking. An initial Systemic Investment Fund
might focus on a wide variety of businesses. Subsequent funds might be dedicated
to specific components of the economic transition – like transitioning the food
system or energy system in the bioregion. Asset class frameworks used by targeted
investors should be taken into account in the portfolio design process.

The Bioregional Bank can be set up in phase 2 or 3, and either before or after
the Bioregional Investment Company. The Bioregional Bank will lend specifically
to organizations providing goods and services aligned with the Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy. It can also provide advisory services. For bioregions that
are interested in developing and issuing complementary currencies,168 including
nature-based currencies, the Bioregional Bank can lead this process, supporting
a shift in perceptions of value in the bioregion. For example, if the Bioregional Bank
issues a currency that is backed by the health of the salmon population or of a key
river flowing through the bioregion, those entities become the basis of the value of
the currency – attaching currency value to natural assets on which all the life in the
bioregion depends (see Section 6 for more details on complementary and Nature-
based Currencies). Bioregional Banks can be set up as Community Development
Financial Institutions (CDFIs) or the national equivalent, leveraging federal or other
guarantees to underwrite loans to small businesses and even non-profits, which are
often deemed too risky to lend to (according to traditional credit risk models, which
do not accurately account for systemic risk or the 4 Returns).

The activities for BFFs included in the templates below are options, illustrative of
the range of activities a given facility can support. It is critical that these templates
are applied and adapted by Bioregional Organizing Teams to serve the economic
transition and regeneration that is emergent in a given place. Each facility is
designed to be flexible and modular: some bioregions might choose to combine
multiple functions into one facility. In addition, existing aligned financial vehicles
like CDFIs, charitable trusts, land trusts, Perpetual Purpose Trusts, landscape and
biodiversity-focused private equity funds,169 could be adapted to become BFFs
or operate in partnership with them. Regardless of the functions established and

Below we describe each type of Bioregional Financing Facility including some
options for the legal structure each could take. Some of these elements are
demonstrated in case studies at the end of the section or in Section 5.

Table 6. BFF 1 – The Bioregional Trust

 BIOREGIONAL TRUST
 Description A trust that acts as a catalytic grant fund. It provides grants to a
 range of synergistic projects and organizations with cascading
 benefits in order to create a strong foundation for bioregional action.

 Legal structure We recommend a non-profit charitable trust or perpetual purpose
 trust structure. An Indigenous nation, tribe, or consortium of
 nations and tribes might have an alternative legal structure they
 choose to use. The Trust could also be an initiative of an existing
 non-profit organization or start as a Donor Advised Fund (DAF), or
 equivalent.

 Building trust The Bioregional Trust is the first Bioregional Financing Facility we
 recommend setting up. We use “trust” to describe both a form of
 social capital and a financial vehicle. These two aspects of “trust”
 must be deeply interwoven in the design and implementation of
 this BFF. The financial capital that flows into this facility should
 be carefully allocated to support the repair and strengthening of
 relational trust in the bioregion.

 Creating a strong The Trust will be responsible for investing in the foundational
 foundation for elements of bioregional organizing and activation. It can fund
 bioregional action any of the activities in stages 2 through 5 of the multi-stakeholder
 bioregional regeneration, Table 4 (Mapping and Analysis,
 Convening and Activation, Co-initiation and Co-creation, and Co-
 evolution) – including possibly supporting Bioregional Organizing
 teams. Together with the Bioregional Hub(s), the Trust will be
 responsible for mapping which systems within the bioregion to
 focus on transitioning first and strategically allocating grants to
 support whole ecosystems of organizations that can drive that
 transition. The Trust can also serve as a fiscal sponsor to projects
 in the bioregion that do their own fundraising.

 Capacity building If there are not one or more Bioregional Hubs already in place,
 this is one of the initial activities we recommend the Trust to
 fund. As noted in Section 3, the Hubs will support projects and
 organizations in the bioregion to prepare for investment. Trusts
 can also make grants to projects and organizations directly to
 help them get to the stage where they are operating regenerative
 business models173 or to prepare them for investment.

 Capacity raising The Trust receives philanthropic and public grant capital, as well
 as individual donations. It may introduce a Bioregional Tithing
 program. It is important to note that the public grant capital can be
 sub-national, national, or multilateral, and the Trust may need to
 meet certain criteria to receive these grants. The Trust can play
 an important role in ensuring that large pools of public capital
 (e.g. from loss and damages, reparations, climate, and ecological
 restoration funds) meant to be invested in global public goods or
 common assets are efficiently used and that they reach on-the-
 ground regenerators.

173 Does not require that an organization is profitable, but that it is regenerating itself in terms of its funding/financing
 structure in alignment with the purpose and life cycle of the organization. This approach acknowledges regenerative
 organizations might have a death date at which they choose to end their operations.

 Capital allocation It provides grants to fund key processes of multi-stakeholder
 bioregional regeneration (including what is often referred to
 “the spaces in between” – organizing, convening, relationship
 building, art, learning & integration, etc.) and to priority projects
 and organizations aligned with the Bioregional Regeneration
 Strategy. As mentioned above, grants can be allocated through
 a participatory budgeting process including voting as part of a
 prize model (such as the Edge Prize – see case study), through
 Quadratic Voting (such as in the Golden Bay bioregion – see case
 study), or Quadratic Funding (see Section 6 for examples). The
 Trust can also set up and/or seed the Bioregional Venture Studio,
 Bioregional Investment Company and Bioregional Bank.

 Eco-credits:174 both The Trust can work with key bioregional actors to develop,
 capital raising and bundle, and sell eco-credits (including, importantly, to companies
 allocation operating in the bioregion or companies that have historically
 contributed to extraction or destruction in that bioregion). A
 platform like the Regen Marketplace (see the Regen Network
 case study) can enable the development of a methodology
 aligned with the priority regeneration activities in a given
 bioregion. This methodology should be developed through a
 participatory, transparent process. Once the methodology is
 agreed upon and approved by the platform of choice, the Trust
 can support regenerators from across the bioregion to engage
 in designated activities. As discussed above, the integrated MRV
 capabilities of the Trust will enable it to track credit delivery, and
 bundle and issue credits accordingly. Proceeds will then flow to
 regenerators – perhaps with the Trust taking a small fee to cover
 its services.

 We see this as an effective approach to scaling up strategic,
 decentralized action quickly to drive regeneration. This tool
 could be used to drive long-term outcomes like watershed
 restoration or species recovery, but could also be used to drive
 rapid fire risk mitigation activities in advance of the fire season
 in a bioregion, for example. An important part of this process will
 be cultivating relationships with potential eco-credit buyers –
 noting that there is not yet strong demand for eco-credits beyond
 ICROA-certified carbon credits, which do not take into account
 a holistic composition of biocultural factors. The potential for
 eco-credits to connect corporations operating in a bioregion with
 regenerators stewarding that bioregion is significant. We believe
 that the voluntary carbon market is ripe for disruption, and that a
 bottom-up, bioregional, approach to credit development could be
 catalytic in driving financial resources to regeneration. We have
 already seen a regulated carbon market prioritize credits aligned
 with a locally developed methodology – in the case of Querétaro,
 Mexico175 and the role that the Sierra Gorda Reserve played in
 shaping the legislation.

174 Attestations about ecological state which prove regeneration is occurring, has occurred, or will occur. It is our
 recommendation that eco-credits are based on community-developed and governed definitions of regeneration,
 which are rooted in context and include a composition of ecological factors (rather a single parameter, such as
 carbon) (adapted from input from Regen Foundation). A reflection from Gregory Landau of Regen Network on the term
 eco-credit here: To Credit, or Not to Credit.
175 More details available here: UNDP Equator Initiative Case Studies: GRUPO ECOLÓGICO SIERRA GORDA.

 Common Asset The Bioregional Trust can serve as a Common Asset Trust –
 Trusts: both holding the rights to manage key ecosystems in the bioregion as
 capital raising and commons. In their 2021 paper, Robert Costanza et al. lay out how
 allocation forests, watersheds, mountains, and other parts of the biosphere
 can be held in a trust that charges fees to those who take from
 the commons and compensates those that regenerate it.176
 The Bioregional Trust is well suited to support “recommoning”
 – the transition of land from private ownership to commons
 management. It can also support more effective management
 of common assets by leveraging the bioregional MRV platform
 to track use or degradation, as well as regeneration. Eco-credits
 can support the compensation for the regeneration of common
 assets. Legal structures aligned with the rights of nature and
 self-sovereign nature could be applied in a Common Asset Trust
 structure.177
 Ecological Recent innovations in rights of nature have created legal legibility
 Institutions: both for ecosystems and more-than-human species. Innovation in
 capital raising and the Web3 space has paved the way for economic legibility to be
 allocation layered on top of this legal layer – enabling bodies of nature to
 have their own blockchain addresses. A Bioregional Trust could
 set up an Ecological Institution with a blockchain address for a
 watershed or buffalo herd and could raise capital into a wallet at
 that address to be allocated to improve the health of that body of
 nature (more about this in the Regen Network Case Study). People
 will be elected as proxies or guardians for the body of nature
 to determine how capital should be allocated. Technological
 tools and Indigenous wisdom will both have an important role
 in supporting sensing of ecosystem health and resulting capital
 allocation decisions. This can change from a fully automated
 Ecological Institution that acts based on data inputs about
 ecosystem or species health to a “Convivial Ecological Institution”
 that relied more on human sensing of an ecosystem and its
 inhabitants.178

 entities “discover, connect, and fund regenerative entrepreneurs and
 the emergence of a vibrant Nature State” in the Salmon Nation
 bioregion (see Case Study 1).
 › Sea Coast Trust – a permanent funding mechanism created
 to provide access to capital for Indigenous-led conservation
 projects that place local communities at the center of efforts
 to achieve a healthy environment (see Case Study 5: Spruce
 Root Trust).

 governance entities – including utility districts and urban renewal districts.

Table 7. BFF 2 – The Bioregional Venture Studio

 BIOREGIONAL VENTURE STUDIO
 Description It takes an ecosystemic view of a bioregion to identify critical
 projects, initiatives, and businesses that are required to achieve the
 Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. It then supports the synergistic,
 coordinated development of one or multiple cohorts of regenerative
 organizations to drive systems change. These organizations
 provide investment dealflow for the Bioregional Investment
 Company.

 Legal structure A non-profit, public benefit corporation, co-operative, steward-
 owned entity, perpetual purpose trust, or DAO. The Venture Studio
 could also start as a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) or equivalent.

 Innovation Through identifying key opportunities for a cohort to drive
 bioregional regeneration and resilience and facilitating their
 co-learning and development, the Venture Studio enables
 organizations to create change greater than the sum of their
 parts. This will involve supporting the discovery of various
 approaches to catalyzing the economic transition and aligned
 market development. It can incubate or accelerate organizations
 of various types of legal structures including Indigenous
 economic entities, perpetual purpose trusts, Decentralized
 Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Natural Asset Companies
 (NACs), commons management organizations, co-operatives,
 self-sovereign ownership, and multi-species governance
 organizations. It can support entrepreneurs in applying legal
 structures that support worker ownership, rights of nature, and
 expansion of the commons. The Studio can connect buyers
 engaging in the supply shed179 with entrepreneurs who can help
 address their business challenges – particularly related to the
 risks associated with ecological degradation and climate change.

 Capital raising Possibilities for funding the Venture Studio include philanthropic
 or public grants, grants from corporations wanting to make
 investments in supply shed resilience and to develop future
 dealflow,180 founders’ equity, studio-level equity, revenue sharing
 agreements, or option pools.

 Capacity allocation The Bioregional Venture Studio will invest in and incubate or
 accelerate cohorts of early-stage organizations focused on
 key opportunities for bioregional regeneration and resilience.
 It will support innovation that can drive economic transition
 and catalyze new markets. Each cohort will focus on shifting a
 particular system and will work to build an ecosystem of actors
 that can work synergistically to drive that change – rooted in
 coordinated, strategic action.

179 We use this term rather than “supply chain”, noting that materials do not flow in a linear process, but rather more like
 a watershed.
180 This investment could come from the sustainability, R&D, operations, or even the marketing budget within a
 corporation.

Table 8. BFF 3 – The Bioregional Investment Company

BIOREGIONAL INVESTMENT COMPANY
Description An organization that develops a portfolio of Systemic Investment
 Funds – leveraging an integrated capital approach and
 aggregating portfolios of synergistic, high-impact projects or
 businesses with cascading benefits.

Legal structure It can take various forms, including a public benefit corporation
 (where the majority of shares might be owned by the Bioregional
 Trust or another affiliated non-profit, this could also function as a
 holding company), co-operative, steward-owned entity, revolving
 fund, evergreen fund, perpetual purpose trust, Indigenous
 economic entity, or a Decentralized Autonomous Organization
 (DAO). These structures can involve an “exit to community”
 structure where the community purchases the assets after a set
 time period.

 It is important that this company is legally mandated to serve
 the thriving of all life in the bioregion and is majority owned by
 people working towards that goal, and perhaps by the more-than-
 human life there as well. Beyond this, there is a lot of potential
 for innovation and prototyping with this BFF. As compared to
 the others, it possibly has the most significant potential to raise
 financial resources and create a shift in how those resources are
 owned and governed.

Systemic Investment Funds

Legal structure GP-LP structure or DAO with a capped return structure where the
 fund owns equity in projects or businesses, which it may buy, hold,
 resell to another investor, resell to the community, or gradually sell
 back to the founders through profit-sharing.

 A percentage of profits should flow into the Trust, future funds,
 and/or the Venture Studio. This model recognizes that any
 organization in the bioregion turning a profit is benefitting from
 the commons, and is designed to invest in collective assets on
 an ongoing basis. Long-term equity will play an important role in
 building new infrastructure (built, social, or IT) or a new market.

 Innovation As with the overall Bioregional Investment Company, there is
 significant room for innovation in how these funds are structured –
 including from fund to fund. For innovative approaches, tools, and
 templates that these facilities could leverage, explore Section 6.

 Governance The management of the Investment Company and a
 representative from the Trust should serve as the GPs and should
 represent the interests of the bioregion. The GPs will be tasked
 with deploying financial resources in service to the Bioregional
 Regeneration Strategy.

 Capital raising Systemic Investment Funds can raise market-rate investment
 capital, concessional capital, or supply chain finance. The GPs will
 develop the term sheet for each fund based on market analysis
 and financial modeling to determine the returns priority investee
 projects or businesses can likely generate.181 Therefore, target
 returns will stem directly from those projects and businesses
 aligned with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy.
 The primary objective of the integrated capital structure is
 not to guarantee investor returns, for which blended finance
 transactions are often criticized, but to strategically de-risk,
 change risk perception, fund common goods that projects or
 organizations may generate, and stimulate and build markets
 aligned with regeneration as a result.

 Large investors might choose to invest in a range of different
 funds in neighboring bioregions, around the world, or focused on
 a particular sector or thematic vertical. By creating an opportunity
 for investors to gain exposure to portfolios of diversified, yet
 connected, high impact, regenerative projects, Systemic
 Investment Funds are filling an existing gap in the impact investing
 market. For further details on our current thinking regarding
 systemic portfolios, see Section 4.4.

 Capital allocation Invests in diversified portfolios of projects and businesses
 designed to create systemic impact. Requires consultation
 of a local expert group (e.g. from Bioregional Hubs) to define
 interdependencies and leverage points in portfolios (see the case
 study below on the Hawai‘i Investment Ready Initiative). These
 funds will apply financial and systems analytics that enable them
 to move beyond the widely applied modern portfolio theory, which
 is a theory of speculation based on backward-looking data that
 suggests investors have no way to address systemic risks. This is
 not reflective of the real social, ecological, economic, and financial
 risks we are facing as the polycrisis unfolds, and disregards the
 leverage that lies in systemic capital allocation.

 Examples of similar While we have not yet seen Systemic Investment Funds
 entities operational the way we describe them here, some existing
 initiatives demonstrate certain elements of it, including:
 › AquaSpark – an open-ended investment fund building a
 synergistic demonstration portfolio of companies across the
 aquaculture value chain to take pressure off the oceans.
 › TransCap and Centre for Public Impact: Urban Climate
 Finance – a proposal for a systemic funding architecture
 bringing systemic investing to the challenge of funding urban
 transformation.

 › Seed Commons – a network of 30 “locally-rooted, non-
 extractive loan funds” across the US. Seed Commons takes in
 investment as a single fund, then onlends to local funds who
 lend to marginalized communities.
 › The Ujima Fund – “a democratic investment vehicle” that
 lends to small businesses and real estate and infrastructure
 projects led by members of Boston’s working-class Black,
 Indigenous, and other communities of color. The Fund uses
 a participatory budgeting process in combination with
 traditional underwriting to “put economic development
 decisions in the hands of community members.”

 Bioregional Regeneration Bonds

 Legal structure A series of privately issued fixed income instruments that fund
 portfolios of qualifying regeneration activities in a bioregion. The
 bonds are issued by the Bioregional Investment Company and
 could be structured similarly to municipal bonds.182

 Governance The Bioregional Investment Company will set the terms for the
 bond. These will be based on the portfolio of priority projects
 identified through the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy, public
 consultations, and market analysis. The management of the
 Bioregional Investment Company will oversee relationships
 with investee projects and investors. If there is cooperation with
 municipal or sub-national authorities, the management will also
 oversee these relationships.

 Capital raising The bonds can be structured similarly to municipal bonds and
 tap into the sizable, tax-advantaged municipal bond market,
 which includes institutional investors. They can raise market-rate
 investment capital or concessional capital. It is also possible for
 Central Banks to purchase these bonds to address the myriad
 economic and financial risks emanating from destruction of the
 biosphere.

 These bonds can leverage innovative structures, for example by
 linking to bioregional regeneration targets in a structure known
 as a “sustainability-linked bond.” If regeneration targets are
 met, the borrower pays a lower interest rate. This enables the
 sharing of the financial value of risk reduction that comes with
 regeneration.183 The MRV platform BFFs build will be an important
 enabler to setting and monitoring such targets.

 Capital allocation The Bioregional Investment Company will identify and allocate
 capital to a portfolio of synergistic projects that together drive a
 particular part of the economic transition or address an ecological
 need in the bioregion. The bond will be purchased by return
 seeking investors, so the underlying assets should generate a
 financial return. For common asset projects, such as large-scale
 infrastructure or ecosystem regeneration projects, it is possible for
 the Bioregional Investment Company to work with local authorities
 to collect taxes to pay for both the principal and interest on the
 bond.

182 A similar bond could also be issued by a municipal or sub-national authority.
183 The World Bank has developed a Feasibility-AmBitiousness (FAB) Matrix for sovereign sustainability-linked bond
 criteria, which can be used to guide bioregional target setting.

 CASE STUDY 4:
 Hawai‘i Investment Ready Initiative – An
 Intermediary for Investing in a Resilient Economy
 for All Hawai‘i

 About the Hawai’i Investment Ready Initiative
 In the heart of the Pacific, Hawai‘i grapples with the delicate balance between
 economic prosperity and ecological preservation, especially considering its
 vulnerability to climate change and the fragility of its ecosystems. Against this
 backdrop, the "Hawai‘i Investment Ready" (HIR) initiative has emerged – charting
 a pioneering course in bioregional financing. HIR is a collaborative effort between
 government agencies, environmental organizations, and private investors, that seeks
 to redefine the relationship between economic development and ecological well-
 being.
 HIR was established in 2013 as the first Indigenous-led social enterprise accelerator
 program in the United States. It has supported businesses spanning diverse sectors,
 including renewable energy, eco-tourism, sustainable agriculture, and marine
 conservation. Community engagement is integral to the ethos of HIR, and the selection
 process of businesses to support ensures that local voices inform decision-making,
 fostering a sense of shared responsibility for economic and ecological outcomes.
 Growing a more resilient economy
 In 2017, HIR started pioneering the field of impact investing in Hawai‘i, spearheading
 efforts to educate funders and investors on this approach to financing social
 enterprises. Through the impact investments that HIR catalyzed by linking impact
 investors with viable and promising impact ventures, it has played a pivotal role in
 diversifying Hawai‘i’s economy, reducing dependence on traditional industries and
 fostering a more resilient economic landscape. Green jobs have been created across
 various sectors and skills development programs were developed to equip the local
 workforce for emerging opportunities in the green economy.
 The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 spurred another significant shift

184 A case study on this bond is available in the World Bank report Mobilizing Private Finance for Nature on page 49.

 within HIR. Needing to address the compounding challenges posed by climate
 breakdown, the organization decided to advance from merely supporting incremental
 improvements within individual enterprises to catalyzing transformational shifts
 across entire systems. It became evident that the escalating complexity of these
 challenges demanded equally intricate solutions. The new holistic Theory of Change
 became:

 “When we accelerate the coordination and
 collaboration of capital to seed and scale systemic
 solutions, we are investing in Hawai‘i's economic
 transformation.”

 In 2022, HIR launched its first prototype in shifting systems, focused on the vertical
 of Hawai’i’s food systems. This endeavor commenced with a redesign of its social
 enterprise accelerator program to take a systems change approach. Transforming
 Hawai‘i’s Food Systems Together conducted an exhaustive systems mapping
 exercise, meticulously identifying interdependencies, feedback loops, and potential
 leverage points. HIR leveraged this work in the redesign of its approach. It became
 clear that various interventions would require a coordinated investment approach
 between different types of capital, however, an accompanying ‘Hawai‘i Capital Scan’
 report revealed that financial resources remained siloed with limited collaboration
 taking place between diverse capital holders. Consequently, HIR initiated
 conversations with food system investors within its network and helped them solve
 the problems of a) managing risks, b) creating leverage, and c) placing the best bets
 in this complex investment environment by initiating collaboration and de-siloing the
 capital stack. As a side effect, this also helped to level power hierarchies between
 investors and investees in the face of a shared purpose.
 Catalyzing regenerative investments
 Emerging as a strategic intermediary, HIR discerns the optimal deployment of
 funds to effectively drive systemic change. By identifying where different types of
 capital could be best utilized within the capital stack, HIR significantly enhanced its
 value proposition for all stakeholders involved. The next step for HIR is to track the
 investment portfolios against a set of systemic metrics and to effectively fund the
 health of entire ecosystems.
 Co-initiated by HIR, the ‘Āina Aloha Economy Fund is Hawaiʻi’s first catalytic capital
 fund integrating HIR’s program expertise and research with the work of ‘Āina Aloha
 Economic Futures, a partnering initiative around which 2,600+ community members
 and organizations have coalesced to develop a vision for Hawaiʻiʻs economic future.
 Offering adaptable, patient, and risk-tolerant debt capital, the Fund addresses
 the critical capital gap between initial grants or startup funding and commercial
 capital. It helps to smooth over the capital stack allowing investorsʻ capital to work
 better together. This strategic approach provides a necessary runway for systems
 entrepreneurs, particularly those focused on Native-led and sustainable foodways,
 to implement their strategies for fostering a more equitable and regenerative island
 economy. In addition to financial support, the Fund is committed to enhancing the
 success of these enterprises by offering ongoing technical assistance and help to
 navigate resources and other financial providers.
 Beyond catalyzing funds and investment across the capital stack, HIR has recognized
 the important role of policy and advocacy work in order to win a supportive enabling

 environment for bioregional investments. It is thus actively collaborating with
 other institutions to facilitate conversations between funders, entrepreneurs, and
 policymakers.
 As an intermediary at the intersection of systems change and capital allocation,
 HIR currently operates on catalytic grant capital from philanthropy, distinct from the
 investments made in for-profit ventures and not-for-profit projects within its cohorts.
 HIR aims to transform Hawai‘i‘s systems (such as food & agriculture, housing &
 real estate, etc.) and to serve as an example of how a non-profit can catalyze the
 transition to a regenerative economy. In its own words, HIR describes this ambition as
 “becoming a fractal of what could happen in a more holistic global financial system.”

Table 9. BFF 4 – The Bioregional Bank

 BIOREGIONAL BANK
 Description A Bioregional Bank that provides low-interest loans, microloans,
 lines of credit, and technical assistance to aligned organizations
 (including corporations, for-purpose businesses, non-profit
 organizations, and co-ops). The Bioregional Bank can also provide
 retail banking services to individuals and can develop and issue a
 complementary or nature-based currency.

 Legal structure We recommend the Bioregional Bank is set up as a bank, public
 bank, Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), non-
 profit,185 a publicly-owned entity (owned by the bioregion), or a
 credit union (with partial ownership by the Bioregional Trust and
 investors) under the relevant national jurisdiction.

 Leveraging debt As a bioregion transitions to a regenerative economy, it might
 financing to eventually wish to have its own bank. One initial option would be
 enable economic to establish this Bioregional Bank as a CDFI. The long track record
 transformation of CDFIs and all of the hard work of their champions provide a
 roadmap for the path that Bioregional Banks could take. There
 are many examples of CDFIs supporting the development of 4
 Returns, and indeed, the mission of CDFIs is aligned with many
 of the attributes of BFFs. CDFIs have successfully leveraged
 public capital or attained public guarantees to mobilize private
 investment,186 based on a model that empowers the CDFI to use
 flexible underwriting criteria to assess loan applications, enabling
 the use of relational information and local knowledge to guide risk
 assessment/management and capital allocation.

 Difference from A Bioregional Bank has two main differences from a conventional
 traditional CDFIs CDFI: (i) It takes a systemic approach to lending, aligned with
 achieving the vision of the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy
 and (ii) it may issue a complementary currency. Its capitalization
 structure may also reflect a bioregional focus.

185 There are multiple types of CDFIs including banks, credit unions, loan funds, and venture capital funds.
186 CDFIs leverage an estimated $12 of private capital for every $1 of public investment (CDFI Coalition).

 Capital raising Bioregional Banks can raise philanthropic grants, public grants,187
 concessionary investment capital, and investment capital via
 deposits from individuals or organizations. Importantly, Bioregional
 Banks, like their CDFI counterparts, will seek to leverage
 guarantees. Some impact investors invest in portfolios of CDFIs
 and could do the same with Bioregional Banks. Organizations like
 the Native CDFI Network188 could be helpful to partners as they
 assist Bioregional Banks in raising capital.

 Capital allocation Bioregional Banks can provide low interest loans or revolving lines
 of credit to aligned organizations. They will also be able to offer
 technical assistance.

 Currency For bioregions that are interested in developing a complementary
 development currency (including nature-based, energy-based, or community
 currencies), the Bioregional Banks can design and issue this
 currency to support a more contextual, relational, and dynamic
 approach to valuation and value flow within the bioregion (see
 more about this in Section 6.2). Such a currency can incentivize
 biocultural regeneration. By creating its own currency, a bioregion
 can also create more economic sovereignty and resilience
 – possibly moving towards managing its own values-aligned
 monetary policy.189 Complementary currencies have been shown
 to reduce dependence on external capital over time.190

 Examples of similar › CDFIs are mission-driven financial institutions dedicated to
 entities serving marginalized communities. As of 2022, more than
 1,300 certified CDFIs across the United States held nearly
 $247 billion in total assets (Federal Reserve Bank of San
 Francisco). Their primary goal is to promote economic
 development, increase access to capital, and address
 financial gaps in areas where traditional financial institutions
 may not adequately serve. CDFIs originated in the United
 States, but similar entities exist in other countries under
 different names and structures. Microfinance institutions,
 development finance institutions, cooperative banks, credit
 unions, mutual organizations and social investment funds can
 serve a similar purpose.
 › Spruce Root (see Case Study 5) – an Indigenous-led CDFI in
 Alaska that supports Indigenous-owned businesses through
 providing low interest loans and technical assistance.
 › Walden Mutual Bank – a local bank that invests deposits in
 food systems change in New England and New York through
 offering strategically designed loans to support regenerative
 farming.

187 In addition to the US CDFI Fund, several states in the US have introduced funds dedicated to capitalizing CDFIs. Other
 governments have similar lending programs or can consider creating a national or multiple subnational funds to
 capitalize BCDFIs.
188 Organizations like this have a track record that enables them to qualify for federal funding. The Native CDFI Network
 was recently selected to receive a Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) award of $400M from the
 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This award will enable the Native CDFI Network to support 63 community lenders
 across Indian Country to fund ‘renewable energy, energy-efficient upgrades, and sustainability projects that will
 enhance well-being and create employment opportunities for Native people.’
189 Many communities around the world wish to move away from the use of currencies that hinge on an infinite growth
 paradigm.
190 More about this in research on the Grassroots Economics Foundation’s Community Inclusion Currency (CIC)
 implemented in Kenya.

 › Beneficial State Bank – a CDFI based in Oakland, CA
 that focuses on uplifting low-to-moderate communities
 (particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area). 79% of its lending
 portfolio in 2022 supported sectors that “positively impact
 local communities and the planet.”
 › Triodos Bank – A Netherlands based bank that only lends to
 organizations “in the real economy working to bring about
 positive and lasting change.” The bank does not lend to “any
 organization that puts profit before people and planet.”

 CASE STUDY 5:
 Spruce Root – An Indigenous-led CDFI Catalyzing a
 Regenerative Economy
 By: Alana Peterson, Kalah Duncan, and India Rose Matharu-Daley

 Spruce Root
 Founded in 2012, Spruce Root is a CDFI based in Juneau, AK, that works to empower
 Alaskan Natives, Indigenous peoples, rural populations and communities across
 Southeast Alaska through equitable economic development. Spruce Root serves 23
 communities from Yakutat in the north to Hydaburg in the south.
 Spruce Root's core programs encompass small business lending, comprehensive
 business education, and personalized coaching services.These initiatives are aimed
 at building organizational capacity, enabling locally-driven enterprises to strengthen
 Southeast Alaska's economy, promote inclusivity, generate quality employment
 opportunities, and foster community well-being. In addition to entrepreneurial support,
 Spruce Root provides technical assistance and facilitation services to support
 regenerative collaboration between public, private, and Indigenous stakeholders.
 Spruce Root was founded with $500,000 in seed funding from the Sealaska
 Corporation, one of a dozen regional Alaska Native corporations created in 1971
 by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). Owned by more than 26,000
 Tlingít, Haida, and Tsimshian shareholders, Sealaska’s mission is to strengthen its
 people, culture, and homelands by creating economic prosperity and protecting the
 environment. Sealaska owns and manages 362,000 acres of land on behalf of its
 Indigenous constituents, and dominated the timber industry in the region until 2021,
 when it renounced commercial logging (Resneck et al., 2023). Now, Sealaska has set
 aside 176,000 acres of Tongass rainforest for carbon sequestration in partnership
 with The Nature Conservancy (Woocheen, no date). The seed funding for Spruce Root
 came from sales of the resulting carbon credits.
 Spruce Root's business development programs
 Spruce Root's small business lending program targets entrepreneurs who may not
 have access to affordable capital through traditional financing channels. However,
 the program remains open to considering applicants who contribute to economic
 development and community well-being in the region. Before potential borrowers
 apply for a loan, Spruce Root provides business and career coaching, and supports
 them after the loan is issued. The loans can fund startup capital, working capital,
 business expansion, and more. Between 2012 and 2022, Spruce Root deployed

 $1.2 million in loan capital and, in 2022, it issued loans to four Alaska small businesses
 totaling $350,000. In 2023 new loans deployed amounted to just under $900,000.
 Outside the small business lending program, Spruce Root offers business coaching
 to other stakeholders. For example, in 2022, Spruce Root provided business basics
 training to Tlingit and Haida citizens, and partnered with Sealaska Heritage Institute on
 developing a business curriculum for Alaska Native artists.
 Spruce Root also organizes workshops and competitions for Southeast Alaska
 entrepreneurs. Its Path to Prosperity business development competition supports
 local businesses that have positive social, economic, and ecological impact and
 promote the regenerative use of the region’s resources. In 2022, the competition
 attracted 23 applications from eight communities. The 12 finalists attended an
 in-person Business Boot Camp, and received 26+ hours of training and technical
 assistance from 14 mentors.
 In addition, Spruce Root supports Southeast Alaska communities through
 strategic planning and workforce development. In 2022, it finalized and took part in
 implementing a five-year strategic plan for the Sitka Tribe of Alaska and began to
 facilitate an update of the comprehensive community plan for Yakutat in partnership
 with the local government. Spruce Root also provided one-on-one careers coaching
 for 10 people from multiple sectors, and led various workshops and training across
 the region for youth employment and leadership.led an internship program for
 young people at Sealaska, and collaborated with the Sitka Tribe of Alaska on a youth
 employment program. For more information see Spruce Root 2022 Annual Report.
 Sustainable Southeast Partnership (SSP)
 The Sustainable Southeast Partnership (SSP), a program of Spruce Root and
 Sealaska, is a regional network based on a collective impact model. The SSP aims
 to foster collaborative, community-driven initiatives that address complex social,
 ecological, and economic challenges in the region in accordance with Indigenous
 values. Any individual, organization, business, or government can join, and the
 network includes Tribal governments, Native corporations and entities, community-
 minded organizations, state and federal agencies, local businesses, and more.
 The SSP appoints community catalysts hosted by village-level entities to conduct
 community assessments of energy, food, and natural resource and economic
 sustainability. The community catalysts identify projects, which range from food
 security and energy independence to habitat restoration and more, and work with
 regional catalysts on project design, implementation, and monitoring. Regional
 catalysts also work to influence the policy environment and develop economic
 cooperatives and social support networks, and organize workshops and training.
 Seacoast Trust
 Spruce Root is the fiscal sponsor of the Seacoast Trust, a permanent funding
 mechanism created to provide access to capital for Indigenous-led conservation
 projects that place local communities at the center of efforts to achieve a healthy
 environment. The Seacoast Trust guiding principles include respecting community
 voices, upholding Indigenous governance and leadership, and valuing the integrity of
 all knowledge systems, including those anchored in 10,000 plus years of Indigenous
 history, traditions, and stewardship.
 The Seacoast Trust will fund the work of the Sustainable Southeast Partnership.
 Projects slated for funding by the trust include Native forest partnerships, healthy
 salmon habitat, Indigenous Guardians programs, youth leadership opportunities,

 food sovereignty, climate migration, regenerative economies, and reduced carbon
 footprints (Seacoast Trust Annual Report, 2023). The Trust provides grants for work
 programs, loans for small Tribal businesses, Southeast Tribal Land Purchases,
 and local infrastructure projects, and exchange-traded and impact fund, as well as
 network coordination and capacity building. Along with Spruce Root, the Seacoast
 Trust also funds the work of the Sustainable Southeast Partnership.
 In 2022, the Seacoast Trust reached an initial $20M funding goal with the help of
 Sealaska, The Nature Conservancy, and the Rasmuson, Hewlett, Edgerton, Chorus,
 and Wilburforce foundations (The Nature Conservancy, 2021). The goal of the trust is
 to reach $100M in order to fully fund the work of Sustainable Southeast Partnership in
 perpetuity.

4.3 Capitalization of Bioregional Financing
 Facilities
As shown in Table 5, we recommend a phased approach to setting up Bioregional
Financing Facilities, starting with Bioregional Trusts. In Table 10., below, we lay out
the types of capital that can be mobilized to capitalize BFFs, the expected returns,
examples of aligned activities, and the potential investment rationale behind it.
Table 10. is meant to serve as inspiration. The rationale for investing in bioregional
regeneration is emergent, and will be developed through prototypes in many places
and critically, through telling new stories about value and about the relationship
between financial capital, the entities that hold it, and bioregions.

One near-term, high-impact way BFFs can support the flow of financial resources
at scale to regeneration is through being set up to receive the $20 billion in ODA
countries in the Global North have pledged to provide to countries in the Global
South by 2025 (under Target 19), in support of achieving the ecological and social
targets set in the Global Biodiversity Framework. BFFs could also support capital
allocation of Brazil’s $600 million Amazon Fund (Reuters 2024). Bioregional Trusts
designed to receive and allocate this funding can be built in key biodiversity areas
and Indigenous territories. Allocating funds through BFFs can reduce overhead
costs, bureaucracy, time lags, and corruption and can also help to address
problematic power dynamics often at play between governments and multilaterals
and the grassroots efforts they are seeking to resource.

195 An example is the US Inflation Reduction Act (passed in 2022) that allocated $3 billion in environmental and climate
 justice block grants and $1.3 billion in neighborhood access and equity grant programs to promote community
 resilience and access to safe, affordable transportation. An additional $40B was allocated for environmental justice.
196 One program seeking to address this, that is still highly centralized, is the EPA- and DOE-supported Environmental
 Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Center. BFFs could work together with this Center to improve its
 efficacy.
197 One such tool is the Accelerate Resilience Los Angeles (ARLA) Living Infrastructure Field Kit (developed by Spherical
 Studios), which enables communities to engage in the infrastructure design process from the start to ensure their
 vision is at the center of restoration activities in the Los Angeles River basin in order to deliver health and vitality for
 the people and more than human life there.

As the wave of return-seeking capital committing to investing in nature grows
(as explained in Section 1), we believe that the owners and managers of financial
capital will increasingly see the imperative to drive decentralization of financial
resource governance and catalyze the transition to a regenerative economy.

205 The World Bank has developed a ‘Feasibility-AmBitiousness (FAB) Matrix’ for sovereign sustainability-linked bond
 criteria, which can be used to guide bioregional target setting.

BFFs provide a pathway for even multinational corporations – that often seem to
operate everywhere and nowhere at the same time – to come back into relationship
with the very real places and people they are dependent on and are in turn
impacting. BFFs enable them to move towards healing and reciprocity through how
they invest.

We have identified a range of return seeking funds under development that we
offer. More such funds are being launched all the time. Pollination and the Green
Climate Fund have recently launched a fund that aims to raise billions of dollars to
fund the transition of the agricultural system to regenerative practices. The fund
plans to finance smallholder farmers via local financial institutions – a role that BFFs
are well suited to play.206 Additionally, there is potential for DAF investment (which
does not necessarily require a return), as well as DAF donations, to flow into BFFs.
We believe that it is important that capital holders build their capacity to understand
bioregional, systemic approaches to regeneration so that they are better equipped
to assess and engage with this new category of investment.

public direct investment can also play an important role in funding bioregional
regeneration. National and sub-national authorities have resources allocated
to various regeneration activities to support the provision of common assets. In
contrast to the public grant capital, outlined above, public direct investment often
involves projects of significant scale. Examples of projects where this form of capital
could be tapped include: dam removal and restoration, fire risk mitigation activities
on public lands, and coastal flood risk mitigation projects on public land.

Tax revenue and subsidies are important sources of funding, which can be raised
by sub-national or national authorities to support regenerative activities. BFFs
can work closely with these authorities to ensure alignment between economic
fiscal policy and Bioregional Regeneration Strategies.207 Taxes and subsidies will
play an important role in funding common assets. One possible structure for this is
the Common Asset Trust model. In this model, certain assets are held in common
and anyone who degrades them must pay in, where individuals or organizations
regenerating them receive compensation commensurate with their contributions.
Place-based taxation districts like utility districts, urban renewal districts,
municipalities, and counties provide precedents for both voluntary (e.g. Shuumi
Land Tax on Ohlone territory) and legislatively-authorized bioregional taxation.

Generally, we want to highlight that capitalization is needed both from outside
the bioregion and from within. While further dependencies on external financial
capital should be avoided, it will not be possible to mobilize the needed amounts
from within every bioregion – particularly in colonized contexts that have been
subject to centuries of wealth extraction.208 At the same time, it is important that both
financial and real economic value flows remain rooted in the community, bringing
significant economic benefits through local circulation while also fostering a sense
of ownership and commitment among local stakeholders (more about the Local
Multiplier Effect in Section 4.5). In this way, external capital can be transitionary –
helping to build endogenous capacity.

208 According to the UN International Panel on Climate Change: “Vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate
 change differs substantially among and within regions (very high confidence), driven by patterns of intersecting

 patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance (high confidence).”

Ultimately, mobilizing citizens and local businesses to become active investors, as
well as customers, clients, and advocates, should support a healthy local economy
that benefits both local and external stakeholders. Complementary currencies can
also play a key role here.209

sustainability and regeneration financing mechanisms. Even where individual
financing solutions are agreed upon today (e.g. a local bank issuing a loan on
concessionary terms to a social enterprise from the region), these merely focus
on a single project or intervention at a time, systematically disregarding the
interconnected nature of real life. From a systems perspective, catalyzing individual
projects in such an uncoordinated manner seldom has a meaningful impact on
overall transitions, and is unlikely to tip entire systems on relevant time scales. This
is one of the reasons why current approaches in impact investing and venture
philanthropy have not delivered the system-wide impact they promised to catalyze.
Often, individual project success is stalled by systemic barriers that could be
removed through policy change, market creation, or connectivity between different
silos of work.

recognizes the complexity inherent to systemic transformation and the fundamental
interconnectedness of interventions. We recommend that they build on the
emerging concept of systemic investing as an evolution of impact investing.210

investment portfolios that create cascading benefits, which enable mutually
reinforcing and positive feedback loops of systemic value generation across
projects. Projects bundled in a systemic portfolio (see Figure 10. below) enhance
each other's regenerative impact and financial performance alike. In addition to
viable business cases, investments in such synergistic and systemic portfolios
will likely include investments in a series of interventions with low or no direct
profitability that remove significant obstacles for other projects to become
successful in both impact and financial terms. These projects receive financing
because of their positive contribution to the overall success of the portfolio. For
example, simultaneously financing a set of farms to transition to regenerative
practices, an urban education program on healthy diets, and a sustainable
transportation system by bundling them in a systemic investment portfolio, helps the
projects succeed and strengthens the investment case. In this case, the education
program creates demand for healthy produce from regenerative farms, and a
sustainable supply chain benefits from increased transport volume from rural areas
to urban centers. At the same time, investors benefit from higher expected overall
profitability as projects mutually enhance their value proposition.

The current investment paradigm, built on Modern Portfolio Theory, aims to
minimize correlation between assets and to maximize diversification to reduce
investment risk. This is based on the myth that investors cannot impact systemic
risks through their capital allocation decisions.211 This assumption is becoming
increasingly hard to justify in the age of the polycrisis and as assessments of how
investment portfolios are contributing to specific risks increase in their robustness
and specificity.

In contrast, bioregional investment portfolios intentionally seek to create a
harmonious interplay among diverse assets, leveraging spillover effects and
fostering mutual reinforcement. By setting the investment strategy to meticulously
select and align assets that complement one another, the portfolio generates
synergistic effects across the bioregional economy. This mimics how resource
flows are structured in living systems, and allows the combined regenerative impact
to far exceed the sum of its individual components.

How this works on a bioregional transition or bioregional economy level can be
compared to how Venture Capital and Private Equity investments, for example,
do not only invest in the production and sales teams of a given company but also
recognize the indirect contribution of, for example, the accounting and human
resources departments as necessary overheads that require resourcing. At the
bioregional scale, such “overheads” might include activism and policy work,
systems mapping, multi-stakeholder convening and facilitation work, conflict
mediation, and the services provided by Bioregional Hubs more broadly (see
Section 3.2).

Through such an ecosystem-based investment approach at the bioregional scale,
individual interventions add up to meaningful, directional, and catalyzed transitions.
Even innovation gaps can be clearly identified, labeled, and signaled to the public to
spur new project development and business creation.

211 In their 2023 book Moving Beyond Modern Portfolio Theory: Investing That Matters, Lukomnik and Hawley debunk this
 myth.

While traditionally, investors or other financial intermediaries would pick projects
for their portfolios, new governance mechanisms in the BFFs could ensure that
bioregional investment portfolios are built through decentralized decision-making
and in alignment with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy.

Bioregional investment portfolios can either cover a series of place-based assets
across regeneration themes, or a range of thematic assets across various
geographies (see image below). This allows both investors with place-based
intentions or restrictions and investors with thematically restricted investment foci
to participate in bioregional regeneration finance. Investing in different types of
portfolios can also help with diversification and investment risk mitigation.

portfolios.

4.5 Shifting theories of value and ownership
As shown above, BFFs serve the realization of the Bioregional Regeneration
Strategy. Their task is to determine how financial resources can best be deployed
to support the transition to regenerative economies. This purpose, embedded in
the BFF structure, enables them to support a shift in theory of value in the bioregion.
Over time, BFFs can also enable a shift in value for the external actors the bioregion
engages with. In The Value of Everything, Mariana Mazzucato directs us to look at
who defines value, creates value, and reaps the rewards of that value.212 BFFs can
enable value – identified through participatory processes including participatory
budgeting – to translate into the bioregional economy, its neighboring economies,
and the global economy. Additionally, BFFs support the transition to a more local

economy – enabling a greater percentage of the value created by the people
there to stay there. The “Local Multiplier Effect”213 shows that money spent in the
local economy circulates more often in that place than money spent at non-local
businesses (AIBA). Moving from an individual to a shared ownership model, or even
self-sovereignty of living systems, can support a paradigm-level shift to catalyze the
transition to regenerative economies.

The concepts of property and ownership often imply notions of dominion and
control, leading us to view elements of the natural world, such as animals, land,
and minerals, as commodities.214 In regenerative economies, timber is not worth
more than an intact forest and a whale’s life is not interchangeable with 23,500
barrels of oil.215 There is value in their respective existence separate from the value
they provide to humans. BFFs can support the repair of relationships between
humans and the rest of life in a way that recognizes the intrinsic value of the
more-than-human world. Enabling the legibility of this value is something that
other financial instruments and institutions have largely failed to do thus far. The
monoculturization216 of value has been reinforced by abstract, decontextualized
economic metrics including GDP that take a uniform approach to assessing value.
It has also been bolstered by new markets like decentralized finance, with metrics
such as “Total Value Locked” that fall into the trap of Goodhart’s law, where the
measure becomes the target. This collapses dimensionality, as such measures
fail to account for real value creation or ecological well being, and do not account
for much needed circulation in our value flows.217 There are promising models
like Bhutan’s Gross Domestic Happiness (GDH) and metrics oriented towards
dynamism and circulation like Total Value Flowed that BFFs can iterate on and
contextualize bioregionally.

Pilots of mechanisms through which BFFs can support the legibility of varying
dimensions of value – including giving mountains and rivers their own blockchain
addresses and wallets – are underway (see more in the Regen Network case
study). Indigenous ways of relating to the more-than-human world, particularly
through a kinship lens, are beginning to spread. Additionally, shifting technological
capacities can support this legibility, as laid out in Gaia 2.0. Finally, the development
of complementary or Nature-based Currencies can play a critical role in shifting the
local economy to align with what people in a bioregion value.

 Governance
 and Capital
 Allocation
The governance structure of BFFs underpins their ability to decentralize financial
resource governance, organize synergistic portfolios, and catalyze the transition
to a regenerative economy. In this section, we offer high-level guidance regarding
several key considerations and aims for governance, and offer various approaches
and tools that we hope will be helpful. However, a full exploration of governance is
not within the scope of this book.
At their core, financial institutions –BFFs and otherwise – are humans coming
together to make decisions about how to raise and allocate resources and build
systems to execute those decisions. In other words, they are ultimately about
governance, and governance is challenging for all types of organizations. Adding
further difficulty, BFFs represent an intentional attempt to encode an institution with
worldviews, values, logic, and context that are fundamentally distinct from those of
existing financial institutions. The beliefs, assumptions, and habits of governance
resulting from education, socialization, and participation in modern institutions
can be expected to cause friction where attempts are made to govern resource
raising and allocation towards genuine regeneration, free from externalities. While
humbled by the magnitude of this challenge, we also believe that the ancient and
modern wisdom needed to support this purpose is alive and accessible. Through
experiments in creating BFFs around the world, the collective intelligence of place
can be harnessed to inform and support an entire network of BFFs – allowing
common patterns of trustworthy governance structures to emerge.

5.1 Key consideration: What are the values?
The governance structure (frameworks, processes, and participants) is what
encodes values held by individuals or a group into an institution. BFF attribute
#3 (Section 4.1) offers the highest level guidance: “Implement an inclusive,
participatory governance structure that represents the bioregion.” While inclusivity,
participation, and representation are values that can be understood very broadly,
each Bioregional Regeneration Strategy should work to clarify specific, place-based
understandings of these and other values that are to be upheld in any aspect of the
work, especially BFF governance. We recommend that the “R Values” that many
Indigenous communities center in their governance (Section 4.1) also play a key
