 Glossary
Anti-fragility – The quality of a system, entity, or process that allows it to not only
withstand — but actually benefit and grow stronger from — stress, volatility, and
uncertainty. Unlike fragile systems, which break under stress, or robust systems,
which withstand stress without changing, anti-fragile systems thrive and improve in
response to challenges and disruptions.

Biocultural regeneration – A holistic and interconnected approach to revitalizing
and restoring ecosystems, biodiversity, and cultural practices in a given spatial
context. It recognizes the interdependence of nature and culture, emphasizing the
importance of Indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices in stewarding
ecosystems.

Biodiversity – Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variety and variability of life
on Earth. Biodiversity is a measure of variation at the genetic (genetic variability),
species (species diversity), and ecosystem (ecosystem diversity) level.260

Bioregion – A region defined by unique physical characteristics (climate,
topography), ecological characteristics (such as soil, flora, fauna, and fungi), cultural
characteristics (such as language, art, and identity), and their interconnections.
There are many differing definitions of the scale and boundaries of bioregions,261
and this book celebrates this diversity as a critical insight about the lack of any
firm boundaries in ecosystems and the need to work with neighbors in bioregional
organizing.

Bioregional Hub – A community-led institution that functions as a gathering place
(physical and/or virtual), resource center, and facilitator of various regeneration-
related activities, initiatives, and networks within a bioregion. While Bioregional
Hubs can offer educational and capacity building programs, much like Bioregional
Learning Centers do, their focus extends to facilitating the flow of multiple forms of
capital (intellectual, social, cultural, etc.). They cohere and strengthen a synergistic
bioregional collaboration network by fostering connections and partnerships, and
catalyzing projects and initiatives that align with the Bioregional Regeneration
Strategy. See 3.3 Bioregional Hubs for detailed description.

260 UNEP: What is biodiversity?
261 One Earth: What is a bioregion? 22 ways to define a bioregion

Bioregional Learning Center (BLC) – An educational hub for gathering and
synthesizing knowledge about local ecology and culture.262 Centers typically
focus on education, research, and skill-building related to the specific ecological,
cultural, and social aspects of a bioregion. They offer various programs, workshops,
mutual learning exchanges, and courses that focus on topics such as ecology,
permaculture, sustainable living practices, Indigenous knowledge, and local history.
The primary goal is to provide opportunities for individuals and communities to
deepen their understanding of the unique characteristics and challenges of their
bioregion while equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary for
regenerative living and stewardship in place.

Bioregionalism – A socio-political and ecological philosophy that advocates for the
alignment of economic activity, ecological management, and governance with the
natural systems and cultures of "bioregions," defined by unique physical, ecological,
and cultural characteristics, and their interconnections. Bioregionalism suggests
that the invisible and visible regenerative efforts occurring across multiple scales
(individual, family, neighborhood, community, organization, ecoregion, global) can
be anchored and organized in large, bioculturally coherent landscapes that federate
through affinity, solidarity, and reciprocity to fulfill planetary potential.263

Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF) – A community-owned institution that applies a
participatory, transparent, and place-based approach to driving the decentralization
of financial resource governance, design of project portfolios for systemic change,
and the transition to a regenerative economy. While a BFF specializes in facilitating
the flow of financial capital between regenerative projects, community members,
and investors, it also works in close relationship with a Bioregional Hub to facilitate
the flow of all capital types (e.g social, intellectual, cultural) in holistic support
of bioregional regeneration. See 4. Designing and Implementing Bioregional
Financing Facilities for detailed discussion, templates, and case studies.

Bioregional Organizing Team – A team of local stakeholders that initiates a
bioregional regeneration and governance process, activates other stakeholders,
builds networks of relationality and trust, and facilitates the collective regeneration
efforts. See 3.1 Bioregional organizing and value creation for detailed discussion.

Bioregional Regeneration Strategy – A co-created, 20-100+ year or
multigenerational plan for regenerating a particular bioregion, including a guide to
the worldviews, values, processes, and principles recommended in approaching
the work. Strategies are ideally built upon comprehensive mapping and systemic
analysis and employ long-term thinking. See 3.1 Bioregional organizing and value
creation for detailed discussion.

262 Joe Brewer: What is a Bioregional Learning Center?
263 This is articulated in the vision, mission, and goals of the Regenerative Communities Network.

Bioregional Tithing – A program through which citizens residing or organizations
operating in the bioregion opt to “tithe” by donating a certain amount annually
or monthly (based on their income or profits) to the Bioregional Trust to support
regeneration of the bioregion they are tasked with stewarding. This program
recognizes that while all humans are meant to be stewards of the lands and waters
of their place, some are better placed to do this work directly, while others can
support them with financial resources. Inspiration can be taken from the Ohlone
Sogorea Te’ Land Trust and its calculator for the voluntary Shuumi Land Tax.264

Biosphere – The thin life-supporting stratum of Earth’s surface, extending from a few
kilometers into the atmosphere to the deep-sea vents of the ocean. It is composed
of living organisms and nonliving factors from which the organisms derive energy
and nutrients. The biosphere supports all life on Earth, estimated at 3 to 30 million
species of plants, animals, fungi, single-celled prokaryotes such as bacteria, and
single-celled eukaryotes such as protozoans.265

Carbon-tunnel vision – A myopic perspective that ignores the multiple
interdependent socio-ecological system crises that we face to focus only on carbon
emissions, and/or focuses solely on carbon emissions reductions as the key climate
change response.266

Cascading benefits – A term coined by Buckminster Fuller used to describe how
benefits from one well-designed change in a system can create enabling conditions
for other beneficial changes.

Common assets (also referred to as commons) – A type of resource that is
collectively owned, used, or engaged with by a group of people. Commons can
range from local resources like forests, fisheries, and urban spaces, to global
resources like the biosphere, atmosphere, digital networks, and data. Elinor
Ostrom's work challenged the traditional notion that commons are inevitably
subject to degradation or overuse ("the tragedy of the commons"), and instead
demonstrated through empirical studies that communities are capable of
developing effective rules and institutions to sustainably manage and govern
commons over the long term.267 “Commoning” and “re-commoning” are also
coming into increasing use as verbs to describe the practice of forming and
governing new commons or recovering historical commons from a present
privatized state.

Community organizing, weaving, and activation – The processes of gathering,
facilitating connection between, and empowering community towards a shared
purpose and vision. The Bioregional Weaving Labs consortium outlines five core
Weaving Practices: Helping systems see and sense themselves; Cultivating trust-
based relationship; Aligning on a shared purpose and vision; Facilitating collective
(un)learning; Fostering (experimental) action.268

264 The Sogorea Te’ Land Trust received a $20 million Shuumi Land Tax contribution in early 2024 - the single largest
 known cash gift to a Native land trust in history.

Complementary currencies – A form of currency or exchange medium that
operates alongside the national currency system, providing a means of transaction
and value exchange within a specific community or network. They are designed to
complement rather than replace national currencies and “to facilitate transactions
that otherwise wouldn’t occur, linking otherwise unused resources to unmet needs,
and encouraging diversity and interconnections that otherwise wouldn’t exist.”269
Complementary currencies can take various forms including local currencies, time-
based currencies, rewards programs, or digital/blockchain-based tokens.

Conviction Voting – An approach to collective decision-making where individuals
continuously express their preferences for the proposals they wish to support. They
may change their preferences at any time, but the longer they maintain their support
for a specific proposal, the greater the "strength" of their conviction becomes. This
gives community members with consistent preferences more influence than short-
term participants who may only seek to sway a single vote.270

Decentralization – The distribution of decision-making authority and management
responsibilities away from a centralized or top-down authority and toward a larger
group of diverse representatives, aiming to improve the efficiency, effectiveness,
and responsiveness of information processing, coordination, and decision-making
(notably, resource allocation).

Eco-credits – Attestations (i.e. validations) about ecological state which prove
regeneration is occurring, has occurred, or will occur. It is our recommendation
that eco-credits are based on community-developed and governed definitions of
regeneration that are rooted in local context and include a composition of ecological
factors (rather than a single, non-local parameter, such as carbon).271

Ecological integrity – The ability of an ecosystem to support and maintain ecological
processes and a diverse community of organisms.272

Ecoregion – A relatively large area of land or water that contains a geographically
distinct assemblage of plant and animal communities. Ecoregions can generally be
understood as encompassing biome subtypes (e.g. a grassland prairie biome can
include multiple different grassland ecoregions — tall grass, short grass, etc.).

Ecotones – A transition area between two ecosystems where they meet and
integrate. It may be narrow or wide, and it may be local (the zone between a field
and forest) or regional (the transition between forest and grassland ecosystems).
An ecotone may appear on the ground as a gradual blending of the two ecosystems
across a broad area, or it may manifest itself as a sharp boundary line.273

272 IPBES: Ecological Integrity
273 Wikipedia: Ecotone (“ecosystem” has been substituted for “biological community”)

Emergence – “Emergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise out
of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions.” It is these “simple interactions” –
from how we relate to the thoughts in our own heads, to how we show up in our
relationships, to how we exist as local communities – that create the patterns that
give rise to our ecosystems and societies.274

Financial sector – The segment of the global economy composed of institutions and
markets that facilitate the flow of funds between savers, borrowers, and speculators
managing financial assets and liabilities. It differs from the real sector, which
involves the production and exchange of tangible goods and services.

Financialization – A trend in which financial instruments and markets exert
disproportionate influence over real economic activities and policy, prioritizing
short-term speculative gains for the financial sector over long-term productivity and
health in the real sector.

Fractal – A pattern comprising parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the
whole, displaying self-similarity across scales. In nature, fractals can be observed
in patterns such as snowflakes, mountain ranges, and the branching of trees, blood
vessels, and watersheds.

Gaia Hypothesis – Introduced in the early 1970s by James E. Lovelock and Lynn
Margulis, the Gaia Hypothesis posits that Earth and its biological systems behave
as a single, global entity with closely controlled self-regulatory negative feedback
loops that keep the conditions on the planet within boundaries that are favorable
to life. This way of looking at global ecology and evolution differs from the classical
picture of ecology as a biological response to a menu of physical conditions.275

Indigenous – produced, growing, living, or occurring natively or naturally in a
particular region or environment.276

Indigenous peoples – A term holding immense complexity that is best defined within
specific context.277 However, for general interpretation throughout this book, we
suggest the term be understood as members “of a community retaining memories
of life lived sustainably on a land-base, as part of that land-base,”278 particularly
peoples practicing non-colonial knowledge systems rooted in relationships of
reciprocity with more-than-human life, and as a term of self-identification used by
those with “a special relationship with their traditional territory and an experience of
subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.”279 Note: In some
geographic contexts, ‘First Nations’ is used as a more specific term.280

274 adrienne maree brown: Emergent Strategy
275 ScienceDirect: Gaia Hypothesis
276 Merriam-Webster: Indigenous
277 We encourage great care with this term and caution against simplistic categorizations that ignore historical contexts
 of interrelatedness between peoples, and between all peoples and the entire land-base of Earth. We encourage deep
 listening and relationship-building with sources of Indigenous knowledge and dialogue in your contexts.
278 This quotation is sourced from Tyson Yunkaporta’s book Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World,
 which is an excellent resource for engaging with the depth and complexity of this term.
279 Wikipedia: Indigenous peoples
280 ‘First Nations’ is often used to identify Indigenous peoples of Canada (who are neither Inuit nor Métis) and to
 identify people with familial heritage from, and membership in, the ethnic groups that lived in Australia before British
 colonization.

Investment – For this book we have chosen to use the terms “investment” and
“investing” to describe all processes of providing financial resources. This builds on
an understanding that all forms of financial capital provision (equity, debt, donations,
grant-making, etc.) ideally yield returns, as in the traditional notion of “investment.”
However, sometimes these investments are designed to return financial capital and
at other times additional or other forms of capital (see “Multi-capital”). “Investment”
can also be used to describe the provision of non-financial capital, although this
book does not apply this meaning.

Islands of coherence – Ilya Prigogine, a renowned theoretical physicist and chemist,
used the concept of "islands of coherence" to describe emergent phenomena
in complex systems, particularly localized regions within a complex system
where coherence or order emerges spontaneously amidst overall disorder or
randomness. These islands of coherence are characterized by temporary stability
or organization that arises due to nonlinear interactions and feedback processes
within the system.

Kinship – Encomposses a complex and interconnected understanding of
relationships, identity, and responsibilities within human and more-than-human
communities. It is not merely a biological or legal concept, but encompasses
spiritual, cultural, familial, and historical dimensions.

Land Back – Also referred to with hashtag #LandBack, is a decentralized campaign
by Indigenous Australians, Indigenous peoples in Canada, Native Americans in the
United States, other Indigenous peoples, and allies alike, that seeks to reestablish
Indigenous sovereignty, with political and economic control of their ancestral
lands. Land Back promotes a return to communal land ownership of traditional and
unceded Indigenous lands and rejects colonial concepts of real estate and private
land ownership.281

Living in relationship to place – Having an intentional, embodied, and perhaps
spiritual connection and responsibility to specific lands, ecology, and place-
based culture. In contrast, many people in modern culture may experience a
“placelessness” – a disconnection from geographic roots due to factors like
globalization, technological change, and dominant culture that considers humans
as separate from nature.

Living system – Living systems, as contrasted with nonliving complex systems
– such as the stock market, computer simulations, or car traffic patterns – are
characterized by the following set of key features: complexity, self-organization,
interdependence, nested hierarchies, dynamic balance, and the emergent
properties of cognition, adaptation, and autopoiesis – the capability of a system to
produce and maintain itself by producing its own parts.282

281 Wikipedia: Land Back

Monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) – A process that ensures accuracy,
reliability, and transparency in reporting and measurements. The goal of MRV
is to verify that the data and information presented in reports, statements, or
performance measurements are truthful, consistent, and compliant with applicable
standards and regulations.

More-than-human life – A phrase that intentionally values all living beings and
elements of the natural world as interconnected and integral to life. This concept
emphasizes the agency, consciousness, and relational significance of non-human
entities.

Multi-capital/Multicapitalism – A framework that acknowledges and values different
forms of capital beyond traditional financial capital. A wide diversity of multi-capital
frameworks and definitions – including Indigenous concepts – have been proposed
in recent years to offer language for breaking out of the perception that money is the
only form of capital flowing around and through us.

Natural assets – The stocks of natural resources and ecosystems that provide
essential services and benefits to Gaia, society, local economies, and the global
economy. These assets include forests, wetlands, fisheries, clean air and water,
biodiversity, and other elements of the natural environment that contribute to the
well-being of life and economic prosperity.

Nature – Perhaps an undefinable term (e.g. where does it end?) it is mostly used in
this book to refer to the organic world (plants, fungi, animals (including humans),
ecosystems) as well as world features (hydrology, geology, climate) that western
science does not generally consider organic or alive, yet are being increasingly
recognized as interdependent with the organic world (see Gaia Hypothesis). Within
the context of other knowledge systems, it includes categories such as Mother
Earth and systems of life, and it is often viewed as inextricably linked to humans, not
as a separate entity.283

Nature-based Currencies – A type of complementary currency that bases its value
on the health and vitality of the local ecosystems – the ecological wealth – in a
given bioregion. While most currencies in circulation today are no longer linked to
physical assets, such as gold, communities deploying these new currencies can
use natural capital as a reserve asset to mint the financial capital needed to protect
ecosystems and support the livelihoods of their local stewards.284

Partner states – Multi-stakeholder cooperatives or commons-based institutions
responsible for the management and provision of certain public goods, common
assets, or services that were once the responsibility of state governments, which
instead provide funding and performance evaluation to partner states.285

283 IPBES: nature
284 Inspired by Open Earth Foundation: Nature Based Currencies
285 P2P Foundation Wiki: Partner State

Place – Where geographic reality and human culture intersect. It is the foundation
for culture and economy.286

Planetary boundaries – A scientific framework that presents a set of nine
biophysical thresholds, “within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive
for generations to come.” Crossing boundaries increases the risk of generating
large-scale abrupt or irreversible ecological changes.287

Polycrisis – “A time of great disagreement, confusion, or suffering that is caused
by many different problems happening at the same time so that they together
have a very big effect,” (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). Polycrisis is often used
interchangeably with “Metacrisis”, although some assert that “meta-” offers
a preferable distinction by denoting the interdependence (rather than mere
multiplicity) of crises and the worldviews/values that may be generating these
crises.288

Public good – In economics, a “public good" refers to anything that is both non-
excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning people cannot be barred access, and one
person's use doesn't degrade another's.289 Street lights, public databases, and
open-source patents or code are all examples. Public goods are different from
common assets, which can be rivalrous and made excludable through governance.

R Values – Jan Hania (Tuwharetoa, Raukawa-ki-teTonga, Te Atiawa of Aotearoa/
New Zealand and the Principal of Strategy Development for Biome Trust) uplifts
the “R values” of relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence,
regeneration, redistribution, and reconnection – noting that language must
be contextualized and place-based.290 The authors also uplift re-membering,
restorying, rewilding, and rematriation.

Real sector – the part of the global economy that produces goods and services,
rather than the part that consists of financial institutions and services.

Regeneration – The process of a system regaining its needed energies, resources,
and relationships to vitalize and sustain. Contrasted with “sustainability”, which
is oriented towards preserving and minimizing negative impacts, regeneration is
oriented towards restoring and revitalizing systems that have been degraded.

Regenerator – The individuals, communities, organizations, and networks actively
engaging in biocultural regeneration efforts. The specifier “on-the-ground” refers to
those working in consistent, embodied, and intimate relationship with ecosystems
and landscapes.

Returns – The outcomes (normally assumed to be positive, but could include
negative) generated for investors, stakeholders, and human and more-than-human
community across multiple forms of capital as a result of investments or actions.

Rights of nature – The recognition that our ecosystems – including trees, oceans,
animals, and mountains – have rights just as human beings have rights. Rather than
treating nature as property under the law, rights of nature acknowledges that nature
in all its life forms has the right to exist, persist, maintain, and regenerate its vital
cycles. And we – the people – have the legal authority and responsibility to enforce
these rights on behalf of ecosystems. The ecosystem itself can be named as the
injured party, with its own legal standing rights, in cases alleging rights violations.291

Right relationship/ right relation – As an aspirational quality or state of relationality
that can only be encountered in a unique web of relations and biocultural
understanding, it is not possible to offer a comprehensive and specific definition
of this term. Generally, however, “right relationship” connotes a harmonious way
of relating that is active, reciprocal, consensual, and sustainable (or regenerative)
across dimensions of past, present, and future, with respect to humans, more-than-
human-life, lands, and waters. The term is most often used to refer to Indigenous
ways of relating. Therefore, we recommend learning about relationality directly
from Indigenous sources and relationships, as translation across languages and
worldviews risks eroding its essential meaning.292

Stewardship – The responsible and ethical relating, tending, and nurturing of land,
resources, and ecosystems for the benefit of present and future generations of
human and more-than- human communities. Stewardship emphasizes a holistic
approach that prioritizes the well-being of the entire ecological system over
individual ownership rights, focusing on sustainability, resilience, and regeneration
of natural capital.293

Steward-ownership – A corporate ownership structure that presents an alternative
to shareholder value primacy. It ensures that companies prioritize their long-term
purpose over short-term profits – by legally enshrining two principles of Self-
Determination and Purpose-Orientation.294

Story of place – A holistic narrative that integrates the history, ecology, culture,
and potential of a specific location, guiding sustainable design and development
processes rooted in community stewardship and alignment with living systems
principles. Note: Story of Place® refers to a specific educational concept and service
offering of the Regenesis Group.295

 Voth: Indigenous relationality: definitions and methods
293 A note of caution for spanish speakers: steward is often translated as ‘mayordomo’ – a term originating from colonial
 structures of domination and control of land and people. ‘Cuidador/a’ or ‘guardiano/a’ are closer to the intended
 meaning.
294 Purpose Economy: What's steward-ownership?
295 Regenesis Group: Story of Place

Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) – The ongoing accumulation of knowledge,
practice, and belief about relationships between living beings in a specific
ecosystem that is acquired by Indigenous people over hundreds or thousands
of years through direct contact with the environment, handed down through
generations, and used in life-sustaining ways. It encompasses the world view of a
people, which includes ecology, spirituality, human and animal relationships, and
more.296

Transcontextual – The recognition that complex systems do not exist in single
contexts, but rather are formed between multiple contexts that overlap in living
communication and among living systems. “Warm Data” can be defined as:
Transcontextual information about the interrelationships that integrate a complex
system.297

Quadratic Funding – By allocating funds based on a quadratic formula that
magnifies the impact of many small investments from the community (similar to
crowdfunding) through a so-called ‘matching pool’ that is resourced by larger
capital providers, Quadratic Funding encourages widespread participation and
fosters a diverse array of projects that resonate with local communities. Projects
that receive a given amount of community funding from a broader base of
individuals receive more match funding than those that receive the given amount
from only a few community investors.298

Quadratic Voting – A method of collective decision-making where individuals assign
votes to reflect both the direction and intensity of their preferences. Participants can
allocate more votes to express stronger support for specific options, allowing them
to "purchase" additional votes on a particular matter, thereby aligning the voting
outcome with the highest willingness to pay, rather than solely the preference of the
majority. Payments for votes can be made using either artificial or real currencies,
such as voting tokens distributed equally among voting members or fiat and
complementary currencies with actual economic exchange value.299 (Lalley and
Weyl, 2018)

Wealth – True wealth is not merely money in the bank. It must be defined
and managed in terms of the well-being of the whole, achieved through the
harmonization of multiple kinds of wealth or capital, including social, cultural, living,
and experiential. It must also be defined by a broadly shared prosperity across all of
these varied forms of capital. The whole is only as strong as the weakest link.300

Weaving – Weaving is the practice of cultivating meaningful relationships, within,
between and across socio-ecological systems. It connects people, projects, and
places in synergistic and purposeful ways to help cohere fragmented change-
making efforts. It seeks to strengthen the socio-ecological fabric and the system’s
resilience by addressing the vital and relational aspects of trust, common meaning,
capacity for learning, and capacity for self-organization.301

Web3 – In contrast to the current internet era (Web2) characterized by centralized
platforms and services where user data is controlled by a few large corporations,
Web3 represents an emerging internet that is decentralized, enabled by blockchain
technology, where users have greater control over their data, identities, and
interactions through peer-to-peer networks and protocols.

Worldview – “A set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially
true or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or
inconsistently) about the basic makeup of our world.”302
