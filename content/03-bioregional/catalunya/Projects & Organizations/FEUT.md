# FEUT - Fundación Ecología Urbana y Territorial

## Overview
**Website:** https://feut.org/  
**Full Name:** Fundación Ecología Urbana y Territorial (Foundation for Urban and Territorial Ecology)  
**Mission:** Find how cities can be regenerated and how to design new urban developments to address climate change challenges and build the cities of the future

FEUT is a Barcelona-based foundation focused on urban and territorial ecology, led by renowned urban ecologist Salvador Rueda. They specialize in ecosystemic urbanism and the innovative "superblocks" (supermanzanas) urban planning model.

## Leadership

**Address:** Avda. del Portal de l'Àngel, 7, 08002 Barcelona  
**Contact:** info@feut.org

## Key Concepts

**Ecosystemic Urbanism:** Urban planning approach that integrates ecological principles into city design, treating cities as complex ecosystems that support both human and natural systems.

**Superblocks (Supermanzanas/Superilles):** Urban planning model that groups several city blocks together, restricting through traffic to the perimeter and creating large pedestrian-friendly spaces in the interior.

**Urban Ecology:** Scientific approach to understanding cities as ecological systems, analyzing the interactions between built environment, natural systems, and human activities.

**Territorial Ecology:** Broader regional approach to ecological planning that considers ecosystem services and environmental processes across larger geographical scales.

## Innovation Focus
- **Climate Change Solutions** - Urban interventions for climate adaptation
- **Biodiversity Integration** - Bringing nature into urban environments
- **Social Equity** - Ensuring sustainable urbanism benefits all residents
- **Economic Viability** - Creating economically sustainable urban transformations
- **Democratic Planning** - Participatory approaches to urban design

## Global Influence
FEUT's work, particularly the superblocks model, has gained international recognition and is being adapted in cities worldwide as a solution for creating more sustainable, liveable, and climate-resilient urban environments.
