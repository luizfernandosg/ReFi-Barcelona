### 1. Why an Assembly?

Barcelona’s 2020 Climate Emergency Declaration mandated new participatory instruments. The City Council therefore launched a **Citizen Climate Assembly (ACC)** to answer one empowering question: *“What can we do in Barcelona to confront the climate emergency?”*.

* **Lowest but valid:** LEZ replacement proposal (M10 – 52 %).
* **Median support across all proposals:** 89 %.
* Proposals failing threshold: 2 (energy‑tariff fine‑tuning; automated waste‑sorting trial).

---

### 7. Implementation & monitoring

* City departments must map each proposal to budgets and timelines and report annually on the *Decidim* dashboard.
* An **Oversight Commission**—including five volunteer assemblyists—meets twice a year through 2025 to audit progress.
* Measures requiring higher‑level competences (e.g., electricity tariff, rent caps) feed into Catalan and Spanish lobbying agendas.

---

### 8. Alignment with UN SDGs

* **SDG 7** (Affordable & Clean Energy): E‑proposals 1‑10
* **SDG 11** (Sustainable Cities): most mobility and urban‑nature measures
* **SDG 12** (Responsible Consumption): C‑proposals 1‑13
* **SDG 13** (Climate Action): overarching goal
* **SDG 3** (Good Health): improved air‑quality via mobility reforms

### 9. Value‑add for the Bioregional Knowledge Commons

The ACC showcases a **replicable urban deliberative‑democracy model** characterised by:

1. **Robust random selection** ensuring demographic legitimacy.
2. **Layered evidence cycle** (experts + testimonies) to level the knowledge field.
3. **Clear, vote‑ready proposal sheets** that translate citizen wisdom into implementable actions.
4. **Built‑in follow‑up architecture** (Oversight Commission, open data) that guards against participatory “hit‑and‑run”.
   Other cities and bioregions can adopt the ACC blueprint, adapt its three‑axis structure, and plug in local indicators to track impact.
