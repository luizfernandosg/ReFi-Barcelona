# Microsolidarity

## Overview
**Website:** https://www.microsolidarity.cc/  
**Tagline:** "A fractal view of belonging"  
**Mission:** Community-building practice weaving the social fabric that underpins shared infrastructure

Microsolidarity is a community-building practice focused on shifting people out of isolated individualism into a more connected way of being. The practice creates structures for belonging and supports people into meaningful work.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Structures for Belonging
Creating **kinship networks** that shift people out of isolated individualism into connected community. The foundational belief is that **"belonging is a superpower"** - people are more courageous and creative when they "find their people."

### 2. Meaningful Work
Supporting people into work that is broadly defined by individual values - whether in jobs, family, or community volunteering. Generally focused on **being of benefit to others** and matching talents to world needs.

## Key Theoretical Framework

### Five Scales of Microsolidarity
**Core Theory:** "Groups of different sizes are good for different things" - the only essential theory needed to understand the practice.

### Leadership as Hospitality
A distinctive approach to thinking about power, authority, and hierarchy in community settings.

### From Domination to Partnership
A fractal, radical, constructive approach to transforming power dynamics in groups of any size.

## Core Practices

### Crewing
Small group formation and maintenance practices for creating intimate belonging structures.

### Congregating  
Larger group gathering and community-building methodologies.

### Developmental Pathway
A structured approach to becoming a mature microsolidarity practitioner:
- Develop skills at small scale
- Gradually increase to larger groups
- Build capacity for community facilitation
