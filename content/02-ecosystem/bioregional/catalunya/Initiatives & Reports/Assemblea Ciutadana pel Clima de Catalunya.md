### 1. Executive overview

One hundred randomly selected residents of Catalonia met over six sessions (Nov 2023 – Feb 2024) to craft a citizen‑led response to the climate emergency. Their work produced **30 headline recommendations** across two strategic dilemmas: (1) climate change & renewable‑energy deployment, and (2) climate change & the future agri‑food model. The Assembly's remit is advisory but the Government of Catalonia has publicly committed to publish a formal response and integrate feasible proposals into policy.

This initiative exemplifies [[BioFi Design Principles]] through its community-owned governance approach and demonstrates how [[BioFi Glossary#Bioregional Organizing Team|bioregional organizing teams]] can address climate challenges at the [[BioFi Glossary#Bioregion|bioregional]] scale.

### 4. Key Topic A – Renewable‑energy deployment

The Assembly calls for a **citizen‑centred, territorially balanced energy transition** aligned with the PROENCAT 2030 targets. This approach embodies [[What is BioFi?|BioFi]] principles of decentralized governance and place-based energy systems.

| Cluster                           | Intent                                        | Flagship measures                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. Empower self‑consumption**   | Democratise generation and cut emissions fast | Grants & technical offices for household and community solar; public‑roof cooperatives; legal right to join existing arrays |
| **B. Decentralise installations** | Limit land‑use conflicts and visual impact    | Cap large contiguous zones; reuse brownfield sites; fair compensation for host communities                                  |
| **C. Secure investment**          | Reach 2030 target (2.5 % land area)           | Map funding gaps; green bonds; R\&D incentives; ring‑fence fines for poverty‑energy relief                                  |
| **D. Streamline permitting**      | Remove red tape without sacrificing standards | One‑stop digital portal; national consensus law; penalties for incumbent obstruction                                        |
| **E. Curb demand**                | Pair supply expansion with efficiency         | Public‑building efficiency plans; tiered tariffs; mass‑media behaviour‑change campaign; modal shift to public transport     |

These recommendations align with [[BioFi Design Principles]] of community ownership and could inform the development of [[What is a BFF?|Bioregional Financing Facilities]] focused on renewable energy transition.

### 5. Key Topic B – Agri‑food production & consumption

Recommendations seek **sovereignty, resilience and lower emissions** across the food chain. These align closely with the work of organizations like [[Arran de Terra]] and demonstrate [[BioFi Glossary#Regeneration|regenerative]] approaches to food systems.

| Cluster                              | Intent                               | Flagship measures                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. Local & seasonal diets**        | Cut food miles, support farmers      | Short‑supply chains, public‑procurement quotas, bulk retail & packaging reduction                                 |
| **B. Healthy, low‑impact protein**   | Reduce livestock emissions & waste   | Gradual meat‑intake cuts, carbon‑labelled meat, anti‑waste education, mandatory origin labelling                  |
| **C. Water‑smart tech**              | Climate‑proof agriculture            | Precision irrigation, reuse of grey water, tech transfer to smallholders                                          |
| **D. Diversified crops & soil care** | Regenerate land & boost biodiversity | Incentives for legumes, cover crops; access to idle land; revamped CAP criteria                                   |
| **E. Mixed/extensive livestock**     | Balance production with ecosystems   | Shift ruminants to pasture, valorise forest grazing, tighten slurry management, phased targets linked to GHG cuts |

These recommendations support the agroecological transition work of [[Arran de Terra]] and [[Eixarcolant]], demonstrating how citizen assemblies can advance [[BioFi Glossary#Multi-capital|multi-capital]] approaches to food sovereignty.

### 6. Cross‑cutting safeguards

* **Equity:** subsidies and advisory services must prioritise low‑income households and small producers.
* **Rural vitality:** decentralisation is designed to bolster rural economies and stem depopulation.
* **Transparency:** all plans—locations, budgets, impacts—should be published in open formats.
* **Monitoring:** annual citizen panels to audit progress; sanctions for non‑compliance.

These safeguards embody [[BioFi Design Principles]] of equity, transparency, and long-term thinking that support [[BioFi Glossary#Common assets|commons]] stewardship.

---

### 7. Implementation timeline

* **0–12 months:** government response; pilot projects on self‑consumption and school canteens; legal package for fast‑track permitting.
* **2026:** review investment mapping; launch national water‑efficient agriculture programme.
* **2030 goal‑post:** 2.5 % territory under renewables; measurable reduction in meat‑related emissions; 30 % of public meals sourced locally.

### 8. Connection to Bioregional Finance

The Assembly demonstrates key [[BioFi]] principles in practice:

- **Community-owned governance** - Citizen-led decision-making processes
- **Place-based solutions** - Territorially balanced approaches to energy and food
- **[[BioFi Glossary#Multi-capital|Multi-capital]] thinking** - Valuing social, ecological, and economic outcomes
- **Long-term planning** - 2030 targets with ongoing monitoring
- **[[BioFi Glossary#Regeneration|Regenerative]] focus** - Soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem restoration

This model could inform the development of [[What is a BFF?|Bioregional Financing Facilities]] that integrate citizen participation with climate action and territorial development.

### 9. Why this matters for the Bioregional Knowledge Commons

The Assembly demonstrates a **replicable deliberative‑democracy model** that blends climate mitigation, food sovereignty and rural justice. Its clustered recommendation sheets provide modular policies that other bioregions can adapt, while its process design (stratified lottery, expert input, phased return) offers a governance blueprint for embedding citizen agency in transition pathways.

The Assembly's approach to [[BioFi Glossary#Common assets|commons]] governance and [[BioFi Glossary#Regeneration|regenerative]] development provides a practical example of how [[BioFi Design Principles]] can be implemented at the regional scale.
