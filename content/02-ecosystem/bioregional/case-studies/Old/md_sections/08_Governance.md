-> 5. BFF Governance and Capital Allocation
The governance structure of BFFs underpins their ability to both decentralize
financial resource governance and catalyze the transition to a regenerative
economy. As BFFs represent an intentional attempt to encode an institution with
worldviews, values, logic, and context that are fundamentally distinct from those of

existing financial institutions, governance will be a challenging area requiring great
care and collective experimentation. The assumptions and habits of governance
learned through participation in traditional institutions may not serve BFFs, and both
intra- and interpersonal friction in the learning process will likely emerge. It is critical
for BFFs to cultivate a healthy unlearning/learning culture where they can carefully
consider and experiment with what values are encoded in their governance, who
participates, and what frameworks, processes, and tools are applied.

At the highest level, we encourage BFFs to implement an inclusive, participatory
governance structure that represents the bioregion and is built upon a solid
relational foundation of trust. BFFs governance design does not emerge from
a vacuum, but rather from the rich context of the learnings and relationships
built throughout bioregional organizing efforts and the creation of a Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy, which can clarify specific, place-based understandings of
the values that are to be upheld governance. In particular, we recommend careful
consideration of the “R Values” that many Indigenous communities center in their
governance (Section 4.1).11 We offer many proven and emergent frameworks,
processes, and tools that can support BFFs in both governance design and practice.

Finally, we encourage BFFs to explicitly design their governance towards three
key aims: shift power imbalances, work with existing authorities, and build right
relationship with other BFFs across regions and scales. This is hard, messy
work with no easy answers that fit all contexts. However, we trust that through
experiments in creating BFFs around the world, the collective intelligence of place
can be harnessed to inform and support an entire network of BFFs – allowing
common patterns of trustworthy governance structures to emerge.

role in governance design.218 In particular, we highlight that given the complexity
and delicacy of governance, BFFs can only succeed if built on a solid relational
foundation that creates a culture of trust.

5.2 Key consideration: Who participates?
The Bioregional Organizing Team will organize and activate key bioregional actors,
and identify appropriate bioregional representatives to serve in BFF governance.
There are pros and cons in taking a more democratic approach, so BFFs may
want to consider an approach of progressive decentralization, where a Bioregional
Organizing Team might decide to pursue something more open after a given BFF
has a solid foundation. A participatory process to identify trusted actors in the
ecosystem (including through leveraging Web3 technologies) can play a role.
To sincerely “represent the bioregion”, the management, board, investment
committee, and participatory processes that feed into the capital allocation should
be representative of the people living and working in the bioregion, and the people
that have historically stewarded land in the bioregion (if they have been misplaced).
We strongly recommend that the board be ethnically and culturally representative
of bioregional residents and, particularly, that Indigenous groups are represented
in the places where they reside.219 This is important, as Indigenous representatives
will bring wisdom from centuries of regenerative land stewardship, relational
worldviews focused on kinship, and life-centered theories of value. Additionally, a
process should be established to receive regular input from both youth and elders.
Additional processes might be established to ensure other underrepresented
groups have a voice – including low-income, previously incarcerated, otherly-
abled, LGBTQIA+ people, ethnic minorities, refugees, and others. This diversity will
be beneficial for cultivating the collective intelligence needed to effectively drive
financial capital to regeneration. We strongly recommend that governance boards
rotate periodically in order to bring new energy and ideas to BFFs. For the board in
particular, a town hall or election could be held to select members.
We also recommend the inclusion of representatives for more-than-human life
on BFF boards to ensure that the financial capital raised is not used to narrowly
serve human interests, but is allocated to serve all of the life in the bioregion. There
is a growing body of work around rights of nature and how nature can be given
jurisdictional rights. Species and geological or hydrological features (e.g. rivers and
mountains) are also being placed on boards through human proxies and even own
assets (more about this in the case study on Regen Network).220
Technical expertise and relationships with key stakeholders will also be important
enablers for effective BFF governance. BFF management teams must be bridge
builders – understanding economics, finance, systems change, as well as having
a connection to local context, risks, and opportunities. Team members are likely Transcontextual – The

management. The BFF management team should be adept at using software
tools – including the latest nature MRV, community engagement, and participatory
budgeting software. Governance representatives should also be long-term thinkers,
as they will be making investment decisions that should align with a 20-100+ year or
multigenerational Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Selecting the right people for
these positions is critical in ensuring that BFFs can effectively serve as connective
tissue.
Another consideration for BFF governance is the interplay between public and
expert forums. Public forums should be a place for free expression and, therefore,
not dominated by experts, while expert forums222 should provide latitude for experts
to exchange specialized knowledge without having to conform to popular opinion
or to cultivate a following. BFF governance processes should support this balance,
and the integration of voices from both the public and experts can help ensure that
decisions are data-driven, account for stakeholder needs, and are democratically
legitimate.223

5.3 Key consideration: What frameworks,
 processes, and tools?
A wide range of frameworks can be applied to support the implementation of an
“inclusive, participatory governance structure that represents the bioregion.” We
offer no prescriptions here, besides strongly recommending study of place-based
Indigenous governance frameworks and commons management frameworks –
including Elinor Ostrom’s 8 Principles for Managing a Commons. However, several
frameworks that may be useful in establishing a governance structure include:
— Prosocial, a scientific framework (built upon Ostrom’s foundational research)
 and guided process for designing governance structures that support
 cooperative behavior
— Sociocracy and Holacracy, two similar systems that support self-governance
 and decentralization224
— Traditional hierarchical structures with checks & balances (e.g. wisdom/elder
 councils, purpose guardians/trustees)
Regarding processes, each BFF will need systems in place to enable transparency
and responsiveness around capital raising and allocation. To the extent possible,
BFFs should seek to make documents about these processeses public. Decision
criteria about which projects are selected and why should be published. Tools such
as Open Collective, “a fundraising + legal status + money management platform for
grassroots groups,” can support these efforts in their early stages. The affiliations of
the board, investment committee, and management of BFFs should be disclosed,
so conflicts of interest can be identified and addressed as appropriate. Additionally,
BFFs should be responsive to the requests and recommendations of the public.
BFFs should enable empowered participation – recognizing that all citizens of

224 “Holacracy is one form of sociocracy. While sociocracy leaves a lot of room for many parameters to be set by the
 individual organization, Holacracy comes with a lot of pre-set parameters.” (Sociocracy For All: Sociocracy and
 Holacracy: Sameness and differences).

the bioregion have a right to shape the decisions about the future of their place.
For example, citizens assembled might play an important role early in the BFF
strategy process. Later on, BFFs might host town hall meetings at regular intervals
in order to hear about urgent investment needs directly from community members
before making grant or investment decisions or to get feedback on the impact of
investments.
Innovative social methodologies and tools for collective decision-making that may
support the design and execution of broader governance structures include:
— Liquid Democracy, “a form of delegative democracy, whereby an electorate
 engages in collective decision-making through direct participation and dynamic
 representation.”225 The non-profit Liquid Democracy provides open-source tools
 to support such processes.
— Participatory budgeting through an Edge Prize-inspired model
— Emerging tech that allows for real-time preference signaling (such as Quadratic
 Voting and Conviction Voting).
— Novel voting delegation mechanisms (e.g. Neural Quorum Governance).226
— “Two Eyed Seeing” – a concept from the Acadia and Eskasoni Nations
 integrating Indigenous wisdom and Western Science.227
— Systems for sourcing and privileging contextual data based on social
 relationships of trust. For example, the opinions of trusted subject-matter
 experts and place-based representatives can be highlighted in the discussion of
 issues, which may support finding common ground and weighing of trade-offs. If
 using a voting system, their votes could carry more weight.228
— Polis, “a real-time system for gathering, analyzing and understanding what large
 groups of people think in their own words, enabled by advanced statistics and
 machine learning.”
— RadicalxChange, a platform that provides tools that support participatory and
 pluralistic funding, voting and ownership structures.
— Convergent Facilitation, “a decision-making process designed to build trust
 across differences and integrate what's important to everyone involved.”

5.4 Key aim: Work to shift power imbalances
Shifting power imbalances requires BFF management and board members to see,
understand, and commit to addressing these imbalances among themselves, with
citizens in the bioregion, and between financial capital holders and regenerators.
To do this, they must embrace this work as a collective learning and unlearning –
recognizing how their worldview and life experience have shaped them. For those
holding substantial financial capital or financial and legal expertise, their ways of
thinking, communicating, and acting, both consciously and unconsciously, are likely

228 This can be done without the use of digital technology, and many Web3 efforts are underway to support such efforts;
 In their 2022 paper, Etheruem Co-founder Vitalik Buterin and others “illustrate how non-transferable “soulbound”
 tokens (SBTs) representing the commitments, credentials, and affiliations of “Souls” [i.e. unique, identity-protected
 individuals] can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish provenance and reputation.” (Olhaver,
 Weyl, and Buterin: Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul)

to have been crafted in part by learning how to “succeed” in navigating dominant
systems of power. These learned traits may present challenges in a diverse group
orienting around alternative value systems, especially in conversations of money
and governance. Thus, it is critical that BFFs intentionally work to foster a healthy
learning culture with a shared commitment to engaging in discussions about
shifting power imbalances openly, humbly, and with care. Employing professional
facilitators and educators, along with broader engagement with the BioFi
Community of Practice (see attribute #12 in Section 4.1), can help establish and
maintain this culture.

BFFs can also take steps to structure governance to prevent incentives that might
put profits over purpose and compromise the BFF’s ability to serve the Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy. For example, operating governance can be separated from
governance of the distribution of profits, so that those overseeing operations are not
tempted to drive profits over purpose.

5.5 Key aim: Work with existing authorities
BFFs and Bioregional Organizing Teams can partner and support existing public
work that is aligned with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy and receives
aligned public funding to educate and advocate to local authorities in areas where
they see gaps in public programs; mobilize resources for critical activities when Partner state – Multi-
local authorities are failing to do so; and act as a ‘partner state’ over time.229 stakeholder cooperatives
While bioregional governance, capacity building resources, and financing facilities or commons-based
are under development, national and sub-national authorities continue to hold institutions responsible for the
 management and provision of
the majority of these resources and management responsibilities. Therefore,
 certain public goods, common
knowledge of public programs and procedures can support BFF management assets, or services that were
and boards in effectively raising and allocating financial capital or other resources once the responsibility of
through existing publicly-funded programs. For example, in the United States, state governments, which

strategies for devolving decision making around resource allocation to bioregional
entities. This has been done with watershed authorities in many places globally,
including Washington and Oregon in the US, New Zealand, and Australia. Similarly,
Costa Rica has Territorial Councils.

5.6 Key aim: Build right relationship with
 other BFFs across regions and scales
Bioregionalism is about appropriate alignment with the natural systems and
cultures of a region. The understanding that bioregions are interdependent with
each other and contain within them many scales of natural systems and cultures
is fundamental to achieving appropriate alignment. For example, rivers often cross
multiple bioregions that each have fractal watersheds and distinct cultural regions,
all of which are interdependent with the river. Appropriately allocating financial

resources to support the regeneration of the river and its interdependent regions
simply cannot be done by a single institution. For BFFs to effectively fulfill the vision
of planetary regeneration, they must be able to govern in right relationship with each
other. In some cases BFFs may form relationships of solidarity, deciding to share
resources — and their governance — towards interdependent aims. In other cases,
BFFs may identify the need to invest in the creation of additional BFFs at higher or
lower scales so that resources can be governed and distributed fractally. These are
only two possibilities; there is no theoretically ideal prescription that can be offered
today for what these right relationships should be, as it will depend entirely upon
the emergent capacity in each area. At this early stage, however, it is critical that
BFFs are designed with this fundamental entanglement in mind, and that they seek
to build relationships of trust with other relevant BFFs and emerging Bioregional
Hubs, such that healthy conditions for gradual experimentation towards shared,
interoperable governance in right relationship are established.

There are a range of innovative financing mechanisms that we believe can help
BFFs achieve their objectives. Many of the themes explored in this book are aligned
with the values and patterns driving the decentralized finance or “DeFi” movement.
The authors believe that the potential of existing protocols, tools, technologies, and
templates in the Web3 space to bolster the bioregional movement and supercharge
grassroots regeneration, has – as yet – not been realized. Additionally, there is
potential for further innovation, building on what has been learned in Web3 to date
and what we have laid out with the objectives, attributes, and templates of BFFs.
The BioFi x DeFi intersection provides fertile soil for experimentation. In this section,
we explore a range of innovative financial tools and approaches (in the DeFi space
enable participatory capital allocation, and support the transition to regenerative
bioregional economies. Some areas we would like to see further innovation and
experimentation include: bioregional Nature-based Currencies, bioregional
participatory capital allocation (including through Quadratic Voting or Quadratic
Funding), and the construction of Ecological Institutions for ecosystems or species
to support their regeneration and sovereignty.
