# Why a Cooperative Structure?

## Introduction: The Search for Appropriate Legal Forms

The emergence of regenerative finance and Web3 technologies presents a fundamental challenge: how do we legally structure organizations that embody decentralized, regenerative principles while operating within existing legal frameworks? This question is especially pertinent for local ReFi nodes that must interface with traditional institutions while advancing innovative approaches to finance and governance.

This article explores ReFi Barcelona's decision to adopt a cooperative structure, examining the philosophical alignment, practical advantages, and transformative potential of this choice. We argue that the cooperative model provides not just a pragmatic legal vehicle but also a powerful expression of the regenerative values we seek to advance.

## Five Hypotheses on Cooperative-ReFi Alignment

Our choice of a cooperative structure is based on five key hypotheses about the alignment between cooperative principles and regenerative finance:

### Hypothesis 1: Democratic Governance Creates More Resilient Systems

Traditional financial and corporate structures concentrate decision-making power in the hands of those who control capital, creating brittle systems vulnerable to capture and exploitation. We hypothesize that the cooperative principle of democratic governance—one member, one vote—creates more resilient systems by:

- Distributing decision-making power across a diverse membership
- Reducing vulnerability to capital-driven decision biases
- Creating multiple feedback loops that improve system intelligence
- Embedding checks and balances that prevent extraction and exploitation
- Fostering collective wisdom in addressing complex challenges

Early evidence from both ecological studies and organizational research supports this hypothesis, showing that systems with distributed intelligence and decision-making tend to demonstrate greater adaptability and resilience over time.

### Hypothesis 2: Shared Ownership Aligns Incentives for Long-term Regeneration

The separation of ownership and participation in conventional organizations creates misaligned incentives where owners may benefit from extractive or degenerative practices. We hypothesize that cooperative shared ownership creates better alignment for regenerative outcomes by:

- Eliminating the distinction between beneficiaries and participants
- Creating direct feedback loops between decisions and their consequences
- Extending decision timeframes beyond quarterly or annual cycles
- Embedding the interests of multiple stakeholders in governance
- Facilitating the internalization of previously externalized costs

This alignment of incentives through shared ownership may be essential for the long-term thinking required for genuine regeneration, which often operates on timescales of decades rather than quarters.

### Hypothesis 3: Territorial Rootedness Enables Context-Specific Regeneration

Genuinely regenerative approaches must be adapted to the specific ecological, social, and economic contexts in which they operate. We hypothesize that the cooperative principle of territorial rootedness supports this context-specificity by:

- Creating formal membership relationships with local stakeholders
- Building deep understanding of local ecological conditions
- Fostering cultural relevance and appropriate application of technologies
- Enabling rapid adaptation to changing local circumstances
- Facilitating direct feedback loops between actions and outcomes

This territorial rootedness provides the necessary counterbalance to global, protocol-level approaches, ensuring that regenerative principles are appropriately applied to local conditions.

### Hypothesis 4: Legal Recognition Provides Practical Pathways for Impact

For regenerative finance to achieve meaningful scale, it must interface effectively with existing legal, financial, and regulatory systems. We hypothesize that the established legal recognition of cooperatives provides crucial advantages by:

- Offering clear legal personhood for contracts, property, and litigation
- Providing established regulatory frameworks for financial activities
- Creating recognizable structures for partnerships with public institutions
- Enabling access to existing funding streams and support mechanisms
- Facilitating tax compliance and financial reporting

These practical interfaces with established systems may be essential for bridging between emerging regenerative approaches and existing institutional structures.

### Hypothesis 5: Value Alignment Creates Internal Coherence

Organizations are most effective when their legal structures, operational practices, and stated values are in alignment. We hypothesize that cooperative principles create stronger internal coherence for regenerative initiatives by:

- Embodying democratic principles in formal governance structures
- Expressing solidarity through shared ownership mechanisms
- Demonstrating autonomy through member control
- Practicing education through member development
- Implementing cooperation through inter-cooperative relationships

This alignment between structure and values reduces friction, enables authentic communication, and creates the conditions for regenerative practices to emerge organically within the organization.

## The Cooperative Tradition: Building on Centuries of Experience

Our choice of a cooperative structure doesn't exist in isolation but builds upon a rich tradition of cooperative experimentation and evolution spanning nearly two centuries. This tradition provides:

### Historical Perspective

The cooperative movement emerged in the 19th century as a response to the social and economic dislocations of the industrial revolution. From the Rochdale Pioneers to the Mondragon Corporation, cooperatives have demonstrated their ability to create more humane economic relationships during periods of disruptive change.

Today, as we face similarly profound disruptions through digitalization, climate change, and financial innovation, the cooperative tradition offers valuable lessons in creating people-centered responses to technological and economic transformation.

### Proven Governance Models

Cooperatives have developed and refined governance approaches that balance democratic principles with operational effectiveness. These include:

- Clear membership criteria and processes
- Representative structures for larger cooperatives
- Working groups and circles for distributed decision-making
- Formal and informal mechanisms for member participation
- Balances between direct democracy and delegated authority

Rather than inventing governance from scratch, we can adapt these tested approaches for the ReFi context, learning from both successes and failures in the cooperative movement.

### Global Network and Knowledge Base

By adopting a cooperative structure, ReFi BCN gains access to a global movement comprising over 3 million cooperatives with more than 1 billion members. This movement includes:

- Educational resources and training programs
- Inter-cooperative financing mechanisms
- Knowledge exchange networks
- Policy advocacy at national and international levels
- Platforms for collaboration and mutual support

This existing ecosystem provides both practical support and a broader movement context for our work, connecting us to allies who share many of our fundamental values.

## Catalonia: A Uniquely Supportive Context

Beyond the general advantages of cooperative structures, the specific context of Catalonia provides additional factors that make this choice particularly appropriate:

### Strong Cooperative Ecosystem

Catalonia hosts one of Europe's most vibrant cooperative economies, with over 4,300 active cooperatives employing more than 42,000 people. This ecosystem includes:

- Cooperative federations providing legal and administrative support
- Second-tier cooperatives offering shared services
- Cooperative education programs at multiple universities
- Dedicated financial institutions serving the cooperative sector
- Public policies supporting cooperative development

This supportive ecosystem reduces the barriers to establishing and operating a cooperative, providing practical assistance and models for success.

### Policy Framework

The 2017 Social and Solidarity Economy Law created a comprehensive policy framework supporting cooperatives and other solidarity economy initiatives in Catalonia. This framework includes:

- Simplified registration procedures
- Tax incentives for cooperative activities
- Preferred access to public procurement
- Funding streams for cooperative development
- Recognition of diverse cooperative forms

This policy environment creates practical advantages for cooperatives that enhance their viability and impact potential.

### Cultural Familiarity

In Catalonia, cooperatives are not an exotic or unfamiliar form but a recognized and respected part of the economic landscape. This cultural familiarity:

- Reduces explanation burden when engaging with stakeholders
- Creates immediate recognition and understanding
- Facilitates partnerships with other local organizations
- Provides social legitimacy for our activities
- Connects to deeply-held cultural values around solidarity and mutual aid

This cultural resonance is particularly important for initiatives seeking to build bridges between emerging technologies and local communities.

## Bridging to Web3: Cooperative Advantages

Far from being at odds with Web3 and regenerative finance innovations, we believe the cooperative structure offers specific advantages for engaging with these emerging fields:

### Legal Wrapper for DAO Activities

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) continue to face significant legal uncertainties that can limit their real-world impact. The cooperative structure can serve as a "legal wrapper" that:

- Provides clear legal personhood for contracts and property
- Offers limited liability protection for members
- Creates recognized interfaces with banking and financial systems
- Establishes clear jurisdictional connections
- Enables compliance with existing regulations

This legal wrapper function allows DAOs to experiment with innovative governance while maintaining necessary connections to legal and financial systems.

### Democratic DNA

Both cooperatives and many Web3 projects share a commitment to distributed decision-making and democratic governance. This shared "democratic DNA" creates natural alignment between:

- Cooperative voting mechanisms and token-based governance
- Member economic participation and tokenomics
- Autonomous self-governance and protocol-level rules
- Education principles and open knowledge commons
- Cooperation among cooperatives and interoperability protocols

These philosophical alignments create fertile ground for synthesizing cooperative and Web3 approaches to governance and economic organization.

### Community Orientation

Cooperatives are fundamentally community-based organizations, focused on serving the needs of their members rather than maximizing returns to external capital. This community orientation aligns with many ReFi principles by:

- Prioritizing stakeholder value over shareholder value
- Creating governance rights based on participation rather than capital
- Enabling multi-stakeholder approaches to value creation
- Facilitating the inclusion of non-financial considerations in decision-making
- Supporting long-term thinking and intergenerational value creation

This community focus creates a natural container for the stakeholder-inclusive approaches essential to regenerative economics.

## Implementation Challenges and Approaches

While the cooperative structure offers many advantages, implementing it in the ReFi context presents specific challenges that require thoughtful approaches:

### Challenge: Global-Local Tension

ReFi initiatives often operate simultaneously at global protocol levels and in specific local contexts, creating tensions around governance and decision-making.

**Our Approach**: We are developing a nested governance model where the cooperative structure primarily governs local activities while participating in broader protocol governance through delegate structures, creating appropriate decision-making at each level.

### Challenge: Capital Formation

Traditional cooperatives sometimes struggle with capital formation due to limitations on investor returns and control.

**Our Approach**: We are exploring hybrid capital models that maintain member control while creating appropriate financial mechanisms for different types of capital, including:
- Member contributions
- Community investment instruments
- Impact investment with capped returns
- Grant funding for public goods components
- Revenue-based financing

### Challenge: Technological Integration

Integrating emerging Web3 technologies with traditional cooperative structures requires careful technical and governance design.

**Our Approach**: We are creating modular systems where Web3 components can be integrated incrementally, starting with non-critical functions and gradually expanding as technologies mature and members develop greater familiarity.

## Conclusion: Cooperative Structure as Regenerative Practice

Our choice of a cooperative structure for ReFi BCN is not merely a pragmatic decision about legal form but an expression of our commitment to regenerative principles. By embracing the cooperative model, we're practicing regeneration in our organizational DNA—creating governance that distributes power, ownership that aligns incentives, and structure that embeds us in our territory.

We believe that truly regenerative finance cannot be built on extractive or hierarchical organizational foundations. The cooperative structure provides a tested, resilient approach to creating organizations that embody the values they seek to promote in the world—democratic governance, shared ownership, and mutual benefit.

By combining this time-tested approach with Web3 innovations, we aim to create an organizational form that honors cooperative traditions while embracing technological possibilities—a regenerative institution for a regenerative economy.
