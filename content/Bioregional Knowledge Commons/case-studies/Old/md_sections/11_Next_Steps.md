-> 8. Next Steps and Call to Action
A series of recommendations and calls to action are presented for important
stakeholder groups: Bioregional Organizers; Regenerators and Indigenous
Communities, Nations, and Tribes; Investors; Philanthropists; Policymakers;
Multilaterals and Development Agencies; Innovators and Futurists; Designers;
Economists; and Financial Services Consultants. While many of these actions may
on the surface look like to-do list items to check off, we suggest that they are all –
including the most technocratic and technical – actually suggestions for forming
and nurturing relationships of care, trust, healing, reciprocity, clear communication,
and mutual learning.

Most of these recommended actions are not merely speculative. They have
been sourced from a diverse set of active practitioners around the world. Thus,
our list may also be seen as a celebration of the strength and maturity of existing
bioregional organizing, coordination, and financing efforts. And yet, there is still
much to do, and innovation to pursue, for this movement to cohere, and for BFFs
to be established as effective, trustworthy institutions.
The recommended actions should not be understood as prescriptive or linear. Not

all actions will look the same, or be needed across all contexts, and they do not
need to follow an ordered sequence from first to last. We understand bioregional
regeneration is a complex, dynamic flow of actions and relations across multiple
nested scales within a landscape and our global networks, and we see these
actions as supporting that process.

Finally, we encourage you to consider that by reading this book, you are already an
active – even essential – participant in this movement, whether or not you resonate
with everything written or identify as a key stakeholder. We encourage you to hold
your professional or place-based identities lightly, and approach this book with
curiosity towards the relationships and actions — listed and unlisted — that feel
most compelling to you. Perhaps look up from the screen or the page every once in
a while — you may be surprised by what is available right now, in your place.

 › Work with bioregional organizers to design and collect project
 data and develop an integrated MRV strategy
 › Share project progress updates transparently and frequently,
 showcasing locally and globally what is possible

 Investors › Invest in capacity to understand bioregional, systemic
 approaches to regeneration so that they are better equipped
 to assess and engage with this new category of investment
 › Build private equity funds focused on regeneration of the
 biosphere that can deploy capital into Bioregional Investment
 Companies
 › These funds should be underpinned by risk management
 philosophies that enable dynamic, forward-looking, and
 holistic risk assessment, consider value-at-risk, and have a
 strong impact mandate
 › Work closely with other financial capital providers to ensure
 an integrated capital stack approach
 › Work with Bioregional Hubs and Bioregional Organizing
 Teams to construct systemic investment portfolios in line with
 Bioregional Regeneration Strategies
 › Experiment with more innovative financial mechanisms to
 better deploy financial capital in service of building resilient
 bioregional and regenerative economies
 › Consider investing in revolving or evergreen fund structures
 or structures that enable an exit to community
 › Embark on a personal, team, or organizational exploration of
 what concepts of value, wealth, risk, and return mean to you,
 your team, or your firm in this pivotal moment in human history

 Philanthropists › Support the design, build, and implementation of BFFs through
 the BioFi Project, Dark Matter Capital, or other organizations
 working on BFF creation
 › Start capitalizing BFFs through a strategic, integrated capital
 stack approach, in collaboration with other financial capital
 providers
 › Explore more trust-based, participatory, post-capitalist,
 philanthropic approaches that support systems change and
 healing and reconciliation252
 › Further explore the roots and responsibilities of philanthropic
 capital and how it can be deployed in the most catalytic way

 Policymakers › Explore policies that can drive decentralization of financial
 (nation state resource governance to achieve global climate and nature
 level)253 goals, and to avert and mitigate further ecological, economic,
 and social collapse
 › Take steps to better integrate risks of destruction of life on
 Earth into decision-making on proposed projects, policies
 and regulations, including through developing and applying
 valuation, metrics, and decision-support tools254
 › Engage in economic policy reform to align incentives with
 regenerative practices (e.g., through tax and subsidy reform
 and possible introduction of Common Asset Trusts, payments
 for ecosystem services, environmental permits, etc.),
 especially at the bioregional scale

252 Some aligned resources include: Flow Funding, Post Capitalist Philanthropy, and the Six Principles of Trust-Based
 Philanthropy.
253 Further recommendations for financial and economic policymakers available here: An Overview of Nature-Related
 Risks and Potential Policy Actions for Ministries of Finance: Bending The Curve of Nature Loss.
254 e.g., through implementing or supporting the development of natural asset/capital accounting, developing
 alternatives to gross domestic product (GDP), and developing nature loss scenarios.

 › Consider financial regulation that drives a dynamic, forward-
 looking, and holistic assessment of risk and supports the
 localization of risk assessment
 › Work with Bioregional Organizing Teams and BFF
 management to collaboratively develop strategies for
 devolving resource allocation decision-making to bioregional
 entities
 › Push for the Global North to Global South funding flow to
 support Global South countries in meeting the targets under
 the Rio Conventions to flow directly to BFFs rather than
 through a multilateral fund
 › Set up a technical assistance fund to support Bioregional
 Organizing Teams and Indigenous nations (or consortiums of
 nations) to design, build, and operate BFFs
 › Invest in a portfolio of BFFs through a bond fund
 › Provide guarantees to enable Bioregional Investment
 Companies and Bioregional Banks to raise return-seeking
 financial capital

Policymakers › Implement the actions described above for national
(local level) policymakers that local policymakers also have jurisdiction
 over
 › Work with Bioregional Organizing Teams and BFF
 management to collaboratively develop strategies for
 devolving resource allocation decision-making to bioregional
 entities
 › Create local authorities, bonds, and taxes to directly support
 landscape, bioregional and watershed scale regeneration
 › Take steps to cultivate a bioregional perspective (holistic,
 ecologically-intersectional, Indigenous-informed, systems-
 level) when considering policy and program development and
 implementation
 › Seek deeper and more frequent cross-jurisdictional, multi-
 sectoral, multi-stakeholder collaboration on issues of
 bioregional importance and purview
 › Prioritize funding and capacity-building for initiatives that
 explicitly pursue their work through a holistic, intersectional
 bioregional lens

Multilaterals and › Work with client countries to design and implement BFFs
Development › Decentralize financial resource governance to BFFs when
Agencies possible
 › As new public resources are mobilized – for example those
 promised under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity
 Framework – structure them to flow to BFFs rather than to a
 global fund and then to national governments255

Web3 practitioners › Work to apply existing Web3 technology and to develop new
 tools and protocols where needed to innovate at the BioFi x
 DeFi intersection – particularly in the areas of capital raising,
 participatory capital allocation, MRV, governance, relational
 trust networks, complementary or Nature-based Currencies,
 Ecological Institutions, Rights of Nature, and wallets for
 ecosystems or species
 › As much as possible, seek partnership with “on-the-ground”
 regenerators and communities who are facing contextually-
 specific challenges and can guide iterative experimentation

255 This is particularly important for getting financial resources to Indigenous nations and tribes.

Innovators, › Develop new financial and governance tools/instruments,
Technologists, and business models, and legal structures that can support the
Futurists legibility of both the local and global (real) value of biocultural
 regeneration and support the transition to regenerative
 economies
 › Continue to design and innovate integrative, cost-effective
 MRV solutions deliverable/contributable by place-based
 regenerators
 › Further iterate and improve the concepts of BFFs

Designers, › Support Bioregional Organizing Teams to design and
Economists, and implement BFFs and oversee iterative improvements
Financial Services › Support bioregions in developing and implementing
Consultants appropriate capital raising and participatory capital allocation
 approaches
 › Work on complementary or nature-based currency experiments

 Practice so that others may benefit from it

Storytellers, Artists, › Invite local artists, storytellers, and designers early on into the
and Designers process256
 › Use art, storytelling, and other forms of creative expression
 to engage and reflect the local communities’ vision for a
 regenerative, bioregional economy – supporting a sense of
 common purpose and identity
 › Form artist collectives to work together to create art that fuels
 a movement in the bioregion
 › Submit collective proposals for grants to the Bioregional Trust
 once it is set up
 › Form a national or global fund to resource artists building the
 bioregional movement
 › Connect with local regenerators or Indigenous tribes to
 discover opportunities for connective tissue between place-
 based “old story” and artistic vision for “new story” culture
 creation

Academics › Partner with a Bioregional Organizing Team to conduct
 strategic research to support the development of a
 Bioregional Regeneration Strategy, BFF, or Bioregional Hub
 › Support the development of an integrated MRV platform and
 strategy for BFFs and Bioregional Hubs
 › Support Bioregional Organizing Teams in systems mapping
 and identification of leverage points that can inform BFF
 investment strategies
 › Write about BFFs and bioregional efforts in academic journals
 or other publications.
 › Speak about case study examples at conferences to help
 spread the word and raise the profile of these efforts
 › Publically engage in debates, podcasts, or interviews about
 bioregional philosophy and tools (such as finance)
 › Organize meetings or conferences on bioregional themes
 › Interface with policymakers and other stakeholders to weave
 connections and facilitate information flow
 › Share research with bioregional communities
 › Listen to bioregional communities and help them share their
 stories with other bioregions and the broader planetary

256 Due to historical and ongoing marginalization, it is particularly important that, where possible, these contributors are
 paid for their time and creative work.
