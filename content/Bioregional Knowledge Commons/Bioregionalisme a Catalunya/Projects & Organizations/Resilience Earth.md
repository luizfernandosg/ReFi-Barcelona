# Resilience Earth

**Resilience.Earth** is a non-profit cooperative deeply invested in enhancing community resilience and regenerative design as pivotal instruments for socio-ecological transformation. Their work spans across advising municipalities, facilitating participatory evaluations, strategic planning, and offering formations and spaces for debate to foster community resilience. Their commitment to innovation and constant research underlines their efforts to address contemporary challenges creatively and constructively.

Through their resource section, Resilience.Earth shares a plethora of research documents, analytical methods, and training tools produced by their innovation and research projects, indicating a rich repository of knowledge and insights available for public consumption.

One notable initiative is their Community Catalysts training program, designed to empower youth and those working with youth in climate justice, regenerative economy, and community resilience. This three-month participatory virtual training encourages the exploration of theories, strategies, and tools to design localized strategies and projects, reflecting their commitment to fostering leadership and capacity within local and global movements.

## Bioregional Projects

Resilience Earth operates several bioregional projects that demonstrate [[BioFi Design Principles]] in practice:

- [[Miceli Social]] - Community resilience initiative
- [[NÃºria Social]] - Local regenerative development
- [[Simbiosi Fluvial]] - River ecosystem restoration
- [[Fem Garrotxa]] - Regional sustainability project
- [[Balkar Earth]] - Bioregional organizing and education

These projects exemplify [[BioFi Glossary#Regeneration|regenerative]] approaches to community development and align with [[What is BioFi?|BioFi]] principles of place-based, community-owned governance.

## International Collaborations

Resilience Earth collaborates with international organizations that share similar values:

- **[[Gaia Education]]** - Partnership on [Bioregioning in Practice](https://www.gaiaeducation.org/bioregioning-in-practice) program
- **[[Regenesis Institute]]** - Collaboration on [The Regenerative Practitioner](https://www.regenerat.es/trp-landing-page-catalonia/) training

These partnerships demonstrate how local [[BioFi Glossary#Bioregional Organizing Team|bioregional organizing teams]] can connect with global networks while maintaining place-based focus.

## Connection to Bioregional Finance

Aligned with the principles of [[BioFi]], Resilience.Earth's emphasis on community resilience, regenerative design, and their innovative approach to socio-ecological challenges suggest a natural synergy with [[What is a BFF?|Bioregional Financing Facilities]]. Their work demonstrates how [[BioFi Glossary#Multi-capital|multi-capital]] approaches can support [[BioFi Glossary#Bioregion|bioregional]] transformation.

Their methodology aligns with other Catalan initiatives like [[Arran de Terra]], [[Eixarcolant]], and the broader [[Bioregionalisme a Catalunya]] movement, creating a network of interconnected regenerative projects.
