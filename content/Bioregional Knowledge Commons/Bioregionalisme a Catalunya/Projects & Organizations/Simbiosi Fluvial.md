3. **Unique ecological value**: Working with one of the few Catalan rivers without major dams or large settlements along its middle and lower course
4. **Natura 2000 protection**: Operating within the European conservation framework
5. **Citizen participation**: Engaging local communities in river monitoring and restoration
6. **Governance innovation**: Implementing adaptive governance with a bioregional perspective

## Notable Features
