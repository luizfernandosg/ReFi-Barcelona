world. The ecological crisis, the crisis faced by Indigenous nations, multiple
geopolitical crises, the economic crisis, the refugee and migrant crisis, the energy
crisis, the inequity crisis, and social crises are deeply interconnected and mutually
reinforcing. In face of this “polycrisis,” a key realization is now spreading: the
global economy cannot survive the ecological and social destabilization on the
horizon. This recognition among economic and financial policymakers, the financial
sector, and real sector corporations marks a shift away from the false, myopic, and
devastating view that the economy is separate from the biosphere. Developing
modes of being aligned with Indigenous values in rallying communities to respond in
service to life will be key in adapting humanity’s response to the polycrisis.

actors from across the financial sector are beginning to direct financial capital
towards supporting biocultural regeneration. While on the surface this might seem Biocultural regeneration –

1.1 The state of the planet
We are living in the midst of widespread and recognized destruction of the living
world. The scale and causes of this destruction are widely known and well-docu-
mented: approximately 75 percent of the Earth’s ice-free land surface and 66 per-
cent of its marine environment have been significantly altered as of 201912, and at
least 20 percent of its land surface is now degraded13. The average global popula-
tions of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians declined by 68 percent from
1970 to 2016, with South America seeing a 94 percent decline14. Nearly 1 million
animal and plant species (of 8 million recorded species) are now threatened with
extinction;15 extinction rates are tens to hundreds of times higher than they aver-
aged over the past 10 million years.16

2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global
mean near-surface temperature reaching approximately 1.40 (± 0.12) °C above
the 1850–1900 average17. A recent study found that the Atlantic meridional over-
turning circulation (AMOC), or the Atlantic Ocean current, is showing early signs
of collapse18. The global pollution crisis has escalated to unprecedented levels, as
evidenced by the ubiquitous occurrence of microplastics. These microplastics have
been detected in clouds, aquifers, bottled water19, and even in the human placen-
ta,20 representing what has been called a “slow-motion oil spill” through all the
waters on Earth.21 Additionally, research shows that per- and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
stances (PFAS) or resistant “forever chemicals,” widely used in consumer products,
are constantly cycling through the ground, air, and water and can now be found in
even the most remote regions on Earth.22 14 of the 18 assessed categories of eco-
system services have deteriorated since 197023 and 6 of 9 planetary boundaries
have now been exceeded.24 Approximately 1.7 Earths would be required to maintain
the world’s current living standards with current economic systems.25 Humanity’s
demands far exceed the Earth’s ability to meet them, and this gap is widening.

 Planetary boundaries – A scientific framework that presents a set of nine biophysical
 thresholds (shown below), “within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive
 for generations to come.” Crossing boundaries increases the risk of generating large-
 scale abrupt or irreversible ecological changes.26

 Building on the planetary boundaries framework, the Doughnut Model27 (see
 Figure 2.) by Kate Raworth argues that a safe and just operating space for humanity
 is not only constrained by ecological ceilings but also a social foundation that needs
 to be sufficiently strengthened to reach sustainable prosperity. The social foundation,
 according to Raworth, comprises 12 factors: Food Security, Health, Education, Income
 and Work, Peace and Justice, Political Voice, Social Equity, Gender Equality, Housing,
 Networks, Energy, and Water. The social factors are more difficult to measure
 quantitatively on a planetary scale. Hence, the Doughnut Model is often used for
 local or place-based rather than planetary analyses.

1.2 The polycrisis and collapse
The world right now is characterized by a number of deeply interconnected and
mutually reinforcing crises, which together are driving the unfolding phenomenon
increasingly referred to as “the polycrisis”. Some of these are:

— the ecological crisis, encompassing climate change, biodiversity collapse, soil
 degradation, the pollution crisis, and water and food scarcity;
— the crisis faced by Indigenous nations as they continue to be subjected to harm
 and disempowerment perpetrated by settler colonialism and corporations;
— multiple geopolitical crises, including ongoing genocide, famine, wars, energy
 security, and nuclear risk;
— the economic crises of persistent poverty, extreme inequality, and ballooning
 sovereign debt
— the refugee and migrant crisis;
— the risk of exponential technological development, such as artificial
 intelligence, gene editing, synthetic biology, and novel chemical manufacturing
 creating unintended catastrophic consequences
— social crises, including the anxiety, depression, and loneliness spreading
 predominantly in high income countries; and
— health crises, including pandemics, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.

The authors believe that these are signs that Gaia is not healthy. The Gaia
hypothesis, first published by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis in 1979, postulates
that the Earth's surface is maintained in a habitable state by self-regulating
feedback mechanisms involving organisms (including humans) tightly coupled with
their environment. Through this lens, Gaia is understood as a single, global entity
that keeps the conditions on the planet within boundaries that are favorable to life.40
The polycrisis can then be understood as self-regulatory feedback to humanity – Polycrisis – “A time of great

42 The 1972 Limits to Growth report by The Club of Rome is considered a major starting point of this vast conversation.
 The report discussed results from complex systems dynamics modeling of 12 scenarios that showed different
 possible patterns—and environmental outcomes—of world development over two centuries from 1900 to 2100,
 including a “business as usual” scenario leading to collapse in the first half of the 21st century. See Donella Meadows

The scale, scope, and severity of the ecological crisis are so significant that it has
proven overwhelming to every individual, institution, nation, or coalition of actors
that has attempted to address it so far – no matter how bold their aspirations. Over
the past 60 years,45 there have been numerous instances where optimism soared,
influential individuals gathered with noble intentions, apparent progress was made
– and yet the relentless extraction and destruction of the natural world persists.

In December 2022, organizations representing more than 80 finance ministries
and more than 100 central banks published a statement in the leadup to the
Convention on Biological Diversity COP15 in Montreal, indicating that their members
should “work towards ensuring that economic activity and associated financial
flows become increasingly aligned with a sustainable, nature-positive future.” The
statement cited that, “because environmental degradation often follows a nonlinear
pattern – compounding, reaching tipping points, and sometimes resulting in rapid
ecological collapse – continual nature loss could have severe and sudden impacts
on the economy, and hence on the financial system.”49 Some finance ministries even
issued nature-focused strategic policy plans.50 Additionally, financial institutions

It is becoming clearer each day that the consequences of continuing on our
current economic trajectory are not only unsustainable economically, but include
significant existential risks. Humanity must swiftly and dramatically shift how it
feeds, clothes, shelters, and transports itself. It must change how it builds its cities
and manufactures its goods. It must repair the relationship between people and
place. For these changes to be effective, they must be rooted in a worldview
shift where we return to seeing and experiencing the Earth as a living, breathing,
interconnected organism – of which humans evolved as an integral part – and not
a resource to be extracted from.55 All life on Earth is connected, and so the only
two paths forward are mutually assured destruction or mutually assured thriving.56
Today, we are equipped with an unprecedented array of capabilities and tools
to support us in sensing, sensemaking, decentralized governance, coordination,
planning, and envisioning. If properly deployed, the incredible technical capacities
humanity has built can help us meet the complex challenges we are facing
collectively.

 “Nature is a totally efficient, self-regenerating system.
 If we discover the laws that govern this system and live
 synergistically within them, sustainability will follow and
 humankind will be a success.”

61 Carbon reductionism is one of the main issues with nature-related investing to date (‘Carbon colonialism’ in Africa
 meets resistance). The authors do not believe that carbon on its own is a good proxy for life or the things that matter
 to communities. Nature-related investments focused solely on maximizing carbon sequestration can bring about
 unintended ecological and social consequences. While we acknowledge that there are some carbon credit projects
 that have led to high integrity social and ecological outcomes, we believe there is a need for a broader basket of
 metrics to be used to ensure these outcomes are realized. Additionally, contemporary nature-related investment is
