## Quadratic Funding Round Proposal - Gitcoin Grants 24 (GG24)

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Who We Are - ReFi BCN

**ReFi Barcelona** is a collective building bridges between global regenerative finance and local ecosocial transition initiatives in Catalonia. We are an emerging cooperative (in formation with support from Co√≤polis) that integrates innovative technologies with the Social and Solidarity Economy.

Our mission is to **strengthen environmental and social regeneration projects** in Catalonia, connecting them with new funding sources and organizational models based on transparency, collaboration, and verifiable impact.

### 1.2. What We're Proposing

We propose organizing **Catalonia's first participatory funding round** dedicated to bioregional regeneration projects. This initiative will:

- **Distribute funds democratically** to local impact projects
- **Multiply local donations** with additional matching funds
- **Empower the community** to decide which projects receive more support
- **Create total transparency** in the funding process

## 2. Context

### 2.1. What is Quadratic Funding?

**Quadratic Funding** is an innovative resource distribution mechanism that:

- **Prioritizes citizen participation**: Every donation counts, regardless of amount
- **Amplifies small donations**: A project with 100 donations of ‚Ç¨5 receives more additional funds than one with 1 donation of ‚Ç¨500
- **Promotes diversity**: Rewards projects with broad community support
- **Is transparent**: The entire process is public and auditable

### 2.2. Our Track Record with Regen Coordination

During 2025, ReFi Barcelona has actively participated in the global **Regen Coordination** program, which has distributed over **$159,732** (approximately ‚Ç¨150,000) to regenerative projects worldwide.

#### GG23 Highlights:

- **50 projects** funded globally
- **579 unique donors** participating
- **$96,000** in matching funds distributed
- First successful implementation of **ImpactQF** model (funding based on verified impact)

#### ReFi Mediterranean GG23 Round:

As part of our bioregional work, we co-organized the first Mediterranean round:
- **12 projects** from the Mediterranean bioregion
- **71 contributors**
- **$10,000** distributed
- Catalan projects like **Mas Les Vinyes**, **Fundaci√≥ Emys**, and **Viver de Bell-lloc** received support
