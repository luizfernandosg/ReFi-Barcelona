# Localized Quadratic Funding Rounds - Examples and Innovations

## Learning from Global Precedents

The GG24 localized round for Catalunya builds upon a growing movement of place-based regenerative funding experiments. Each previous round has contributed unique innovations to the evolving model of bioregional quadratic funding, providing valuable lessons for our Catalan initiative.

## ReFi Mediterranean GG23: Pioneering AI-Enhanced Impact Evaluation

The [ReFi Mediterranean round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/ai-impactqf-regen-coordination-global-gg23-retrospective/20385) marked a significant milestone as the **first localized, bioregional round to implement AI-driven ImpactQF methodology**. This Mediterranean experiment combined traditional quadratic funding with artificial intelligence to evaluate project impact, creating a hybrid model where 50% of matching funds were allocated based on AI-assessed impact scores and 50% on traditional community support metrics. The round supported 12 projects across the Mediterranean bioregion with 71 contributors and $10,000 in matching funds, while revealing important insights about the need for region-specific evaluation criteria that prioritize ecological and social impact over pure Web3 alignment. Most significantly, it demonstrated that localized rounds require enhanced onboarding support for communities new to Web3 technologies, establishing a template for how global innovations can be adapted to regional contexts.

## Zazelenimo Split: Municipal Government Integration

[Zazelenimo](https://zazelenimo.com/) represents a groundbreaking **integration of quadratic funding directly into municipal governance** in Split, Croatia. As part of the Municipal Initiative for Quadratic Funding (MUQA), this pilot project allocated â‚¬50,000 from the city budget for green space improvements, demonstrating how local governments can embrace participatory budgeting through Web3 technologies. The platform restricted proposals to specific interventions (trees, bushes, grass, flowers, benches, and urban design) on public land, ensuring projects were both feasible and aligned with municipal planning. Built on Ethereum technology with support from the Ethereum Foundation, Zazelenimo proved that blockchain-based democratic funding can operate within traditional government structures, creating a 20-day voting period where citizens directly shaped their urban environment through small donations that influenced larger municipal allocations.

## Regen Rio de Janeiro: Cultural and Regional Identity

The [Regen Rio round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/regen-rio-de-janeiro-gg23-full-program-report/20423/2) emerged as **Brazil's first quadratic funding initiative entirely focused on regional regenerative impact**. Hosted by GreenPill Brasil in partnership with Fabulosa Lab, this experiment brought unique cultural facilitation through the Regenerative Resources Protocol, emphasizing how local cultural context shapes regenerative finance implementation. The Rio round demonstrated the importance of cyber-cultural facilitation in bridging Web3 technologies with local community needs, while establishing Portuguese-language resources and frameworks that could scale across Latin America. By centering regional identity and cultural practices within the funding framework, Rio showed how regenerative finance can honor local traditions while introducing innovative funding mechanisms.

## Ma Earth: Land-Focused Specialization

[Ma Earth's grants program](https://maearth.com/grants) brought **laser focus to regenerative land projects** with their November 2024 round that distributed a substantial $200,000 matching pool. This specialization allowed for deeper expertise in evaluating land restoration, regenerative agriculture, and ecosystem rehabilitation projects, creating evaluation frameworks specifically designed for measuring ecological outcomes. Ma Earth's approach demonstrated how thematic specialization within quadratic funding can attract more targeted expertise and create more nuanced impact assessment methodologies. Their focus on planetary health and land regeneration established important precedents for how environmental outcomes can be measured and weighted within participatory funding mechanisms.

## Regen Coordination Global: AI-Enhanced Impact Measurement

The [Regen Coordination Global GG23 round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/ai-impactqf-regen-coordination-global-gg23-retrospective/20385) pioneered the **integration of artificial intelligence into quadratic funding evaluation**. With 579 unique donors supporting 50 projects and distributing $96,000 in matching funds, this round established the AI + ImpactQF methodology that combines traditional community support metrics with AI-enhanced impact evaluation. Using both GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 models to generate detailed evaluation reports, the round created unprecedented transparency and consistency in project assessment while reducing human bias. The Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS) implementation through Karma GAP enabled structured, machine-readable impact data that could be processed at scale, establishing a new paradigm for how Web3 funding can incorporate rigorous impact measurement without sacrificing the democratic principles of quadratic funding.

## Key Innovations for Catalunya

These precedents provide ReFi Barcelona with a rich foundation of tested innovations:

- **AI-enhanced evaluation** from Regen Coordination Global
- **Municipal integration strategies** from Zazelenimo  
- **Cultural facilitation approaches** from Rio de Janeiro
- **Thematic specialization** from Ma Earth
- **Bioregional adaptation frameworks** from ReFi Mediterranean

Our GG24 round for Catalunya will synthesize these learnings while introducing our own innovation: **cooperative banking integration** that bridges traditional Catalan financial institutions with cutting-edge participatory funding mechanisms, creating a uniquely Catalan model that honors both cooperative values and regenerative innovation.
