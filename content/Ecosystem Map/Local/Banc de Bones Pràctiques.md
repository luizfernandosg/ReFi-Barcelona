# Banc de Bones Pràctiques

The **Banc de Bones Pràctiques** (Bank of Good Practices) is a significant initiative designed to highlight and spread innovative governance and management practices within local governments across the Barcelona province. Spearheaded by the **[[Diputació de Barcelona]]**, the Carles Pi i Sunyer Foundation, and the municipalities themselves, this initiative underscores Barcelona's dedication to innovation, sustainability, and social responsibility at the municipal level.

Central to this effort is the promotion of cultural projects that drive inspiration, add value, and garner recognition for their contributions to sustainability, gender equity, and broader societal goals. The bank serves as a collaborative platform, transforming public services into catalysts for cultural engagement with the community, thereby tackling local challenges in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The "Banc de Bones Pràctiques en Cultura" offers a digital platform for exploring these practices by various filters, emphasizing the importance of innovation, sustainability, and social impact. This initiative not only showcases exemplary projects but also serves as a dynamic resource for ongoing learning and adaptation, reflecting Barcelona's strategy to foster a culture of sustainable and innovative local development.
