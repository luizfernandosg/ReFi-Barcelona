# CEL COOP

**CEL Coop** is a quality seal initiative launched by around forty federated cooperatives, most of which are members of the [[Xarxa d'Economia Solidària (XES)|Solidarity Economy Network (XES)]], to promote cooperative local energy communities in Catalonia. It aims to advance ecosocial transition and energy justice by offering comprehensive support, including technical consultancy, energy management, installation, and legal and financial guidance, to entities interested in forming or in the process of creating a cooperative local energy community (CEL). CEL Coop aligns with cooperative values such as self-help, responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity, and it emphasizes the creation of clean energy, reduction of energy costs, and social energy justice.
