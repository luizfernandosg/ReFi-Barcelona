# Comunalitat de Sants

**Comunalitat de Sants** is a collective initiative aimed at fostering social transformation within the neighborhoods of [[Sants]], Hostafrancs, and La Bordeta in [[Barcelona]]. It is built on the principles of the [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]], community spaces, mutual aid initiatives, and a local economy engaged with the territory. This initiative is a testament to the community's capability to generate communal, social, solidarity, and mutual aid dynamics and projects, crucial for overcoming the dominion, control, individualism, and exploitation imposed by the capitalist system through macroeconomics and states.

The Comunalitat organizes its efforts around several key networks, including:

- Employment;
- Education and care;
- Food sovereignty;
- Common goods.

These networks aim to provide personalized guidance and training for job search, empowerment cycles for the regularization of migrants, and foster a local economy that is resolved by its own residents. Their activities are directed towards three differentiated aspects: labor training, pre-employment group training, and individualized attention to digitally empower, define profiles, and create resumes, in addition to workshops aimed at the migrant community to foster their empowerment in bureaucratic procedures.

One of the project's strengths lies in its focus on common goods, conceptualized not just as shared resources but as essentials that satisfy needs and are managed by communities that share and maintain the resource. This initiative has led to the production of educational materials and the organization of activities that explore the concept of common goods, their role in ecosocial transition, and their relationship with the state, highlighting the potential of common goods to create dynamics alternative to the capitalist model.

Comunalitat de Sants represents an innovative approach to community-led social and ecological transformation in Barcelona.  Through its comprehensive networks and activities, it showcases a commitment to creating a sustainable, inclusive, and solidarity-based local economy that can serve as a model for regenerative practices in urban settings.
