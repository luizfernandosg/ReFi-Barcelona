# Barcelona and Degrowth

Barcelona has emerged as a pivotal hub for the degrowth movement, which advocates for reducing energy and material use to sustainable levels, prioritizing economic and social well-being, and developing a society that values free time, participatory democracy, and universal public services over continuous economic expansion.

The **[[Barcelona Lab for Urban Environmental Justice and Sustainability]]** is deeply involved in researching the implications of degrowth for well-being, exploring alternatives to neoliberal exploitation, and promoting social justice movements. Their work underscores the importance of considering issues of justice, equity, and inclusion in the degrowth movement, highlighting the need for a transition that is both voluntary and mindful of the social disparities and power relations inherent in current consumption and lifestyle patterns.

The **[[Institut de Ciència i Tecnologia Ambientals (ICTA)|Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA) at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)]]** further contributes to the city's role as a leader in ecological economics and degrowth research. ICTA-UAB has initiated various research and advocacy projects focusing on grassroots initiatives and economic policies for a degrowth transition. Their work includes exploring policies for managing without growth, the implications of a clean energy transition, and the development of community-based natural resource governance and urban commons as alternatives to growth-based development.

In summary, Barcelona's commitment to degrowth is evident in its academic institutions, grassroots movements, and public policies. Through initiatives like these, the city is actively exploring and implementing strategies that align with ReFi's goals.
