# Nexe

Nexe, operating from Barcelona, is a digital and semiannual monographic magazine published by the [[Cooperatives de Treball|Federació de Cooperatives de Treball de Catalunya (FCTC)]]. It focuses on informing and debating cooperative and [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]] issues through projects and initiatives that emphasize local and regional commitment.

It serves as a rich source of knowledge, highlighting cooperative initiatives like:

- **[[Aiguasol]]**, a Barcelona-based cooperative, champions an ecosocial transition to sustainability through its comprehensive energy consultancy, engineering, and R&D services, leveraging the principles of the social and solidarity economy. Their innovative approach focuses on holistic energy solutions, community-led renewable energy initiatives, and a commitment to environmental and social well-being.
- **[[Coopsetània]]** focuses on fostering work cooperatives to combat labor instability and injustice, providing training in creativity, governance, and the integration of social and solidarity economy principles. Their efforts aim to democratize the economy and encourage environmentally sustainable production, demonstrating the power of cooperative and community-oriented approaches across various sectors.
- In agriculture, initiatives like [[Cal Palà]] focus on agroecology and diversified income sources, including mountain apple production with Biolord, reflecting a commitment to sustainable farming practices and biodiversity.
- Meanwhile, the media cooperative movement in Catalonia, exemplified by **[[El Punt Diari]]**, showcases the role of democratic, community-owned media in supporting social and political openness.
- **[[Coopera]]**'s project highlights the potential for agriculture to contribute to social inclusion and ecological farming, offering a model for managing lands in partnership with retiring farmers to ensure social inclusion and economic sustainability.
- **[[MonGaia]]**'s approach to natural cosmetics production in a rural setting demonstrates how adherence to hygiene standards, regulatory compliance, and a commitment to natural ingredients can coexist with environmental and social values. Moreover, the application of intersectional feminism within cooperative frameworks suggests a comprehensive understanding of discrimination and the pursuit of inclusive, equitable practices.
- **[[Community and Housing Cooperatives]]** like **[[La Closca]]** and **[[Som Viure]]** illustrate the desire for communal living as an alternative to individualistic societal norms, offering affordable housing solutions and participatory decision-making processes.
- Initiatives such as **[[Railcoop]]**'s citizen-driven railway project in France highlight the potential for cooperatives to innovate in sustainable mobility, offering comfortable, secure, and eco-friendly transportation options.

These examples from Nexe underscore the cooperative movement's vital role in the ecosocial transition, demonstrating how collective, community-oriented approaches can address environmental challenges, promote social inclusion, and foster sustainable economic practices.
