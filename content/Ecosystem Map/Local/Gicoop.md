# Gicoop

**Gicoop**, the Grup d’Inversors Cooperatiu, supported by the Fundació Seira, represents a collective of investors keen on achieving reasonable returns while endorsing an alternative approach to business. This cooperative society is distinguished by its commitment to providing financial resources, knowledge, and networking opportunities to businesses, embracing the entirety of a business project without demanding additional guarantees. Gicoop's primary mission is to catalyze the growth of cooperative enterprises in a balanced manner, thereby fostering job creation and wealth.

Gicoop's approach to business is person-centered, recognizing the importance of distributing ownership, equitable sharing of outcomes based on contributions, and maintaining a democratic control over management. This model ensures that voting rights are not tied to capital investment, thus supporting businesses that practice:

- Distributed ownership
- Equitable distribution of results
- Democratic management control
- Participation from all stakeholders, including clients, workers, the social environment, and suppliers

The form of financing Gicoop offers includes participative loans or the purchase of participative securities, typically with terms not exceeding 8 years, which can include a grace period if required by the project.

**Operations and Investments**
Gicoop has engaged in various investments across cooperative enterprises, demonstrating a flexible investment threshold. Gicoop provides financial support to cooperatives with both smaller-scale needs (less than €100,000) and larger-scale funding requirements (more than €100,000), indicating a broad range of financial support tailored to the specific needs of each cooperative project.

**Alignment with the Ecosocial Transition**
Gicoop's investment philosophy and operational model resonate deeply with the principles of the ecosocial transition and [[ReFi]]. By prioritizing person-centered business practices, equitable wealth distribution, and democratic governance, Gicoop exemplifies how finance can serve as a catalyst for sustainable and inclusive economic development. This approach aligns with [[ReFi]]'s goals by using finance to incentivize positive ecological and social actions, contributing to a regenerative economy.

Gicoop's emphasis on cooperative enterprises further strengthens its alignment with the ecosocial transition, showcasing a commitment to economic models that are not only sustainable but also equitable and socially inclusive. By supporting businesses that adhere to principles of shared ownership, democratic control, and stakeholder participation, Gicoop facilitates the transition towards a more resilient and community-oriented economic system.

**Partnerships and Collaborations**
Gicoop collaborates with a network of partners, including Fiare Banca Etica and [[Coop57]], among others, to support cooperative enterprises. These partnerships enhance Gicoop's capacity to provide comprehensive support to cooperatives, ranging from financial backing to technical assistance and access to broader networks. Such collaborations are pivotal in building an ecosystem that nurtures cooperative growth and innovation, further contributing to the broader objectives of the ecosocial transition.

**Conclusion**
Gicoop's approach to investing in cooperative enterprises represents a significant stride towards realizing the principles of the ecosocial transition within the finance sector. Through its support for democratic, equitable, and sustainable business practices, Gicoop embodies the essence of ReFi, demonstrating how financial mechanisms can be leveraged to foster social and ecological well-being. As Gicoop continues to empower cooperative enterprises, it contributes to the cultivation of a regenerative and inclusive economy, aligning with the broader goals of the ecosocial transition and the ReFi movement in Barcelona and beyond.
