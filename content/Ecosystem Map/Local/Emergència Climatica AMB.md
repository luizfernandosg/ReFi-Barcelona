# Emergència Climatica AMB

The **Emergència Climatica AMB** initiative by the [[Àrea Metropolitana de Barcelona|Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (AMB)]] represents a comprehensive response to the climate crisis, emphasizing the urgent need for action across various sectors, including energy transition, sustainable mobility, water resource management, and the promotion of a circular economy. 

This initiative underscores the importance of a collective effort to address climate change, with a special focus on achieving carbon neutrality, enhancing energy sovereignty, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through strategic actions and policies.

The AMB has outlined eight core principles guiding its commitment to combat climate change. These principles include:

- **Transition to a circular economy:** aims to reduce raw material extraction and waste generation by advocating for reduction, reuse, and recycling. .
- **Water resource management:** recognizes water as a vital resource for human well-being, ecosystem function, and economic growth. In light of the climate crisis, the AMB prioritizes efficient water use and management to mitigate the impacts of scarcity.
- **Sustainable mobility: t**he goal is to reduce emissions from the transport sector by promoting public transportation, improving connectivity, and encouraging active mobility. This aligns with ReFi's vision by leveraging policy and infrastructure investments to foster environmental sustainability and social well-being.
- **Energy transition:** focuses on abandoning fossil fuels, reducing energy consumption, and promoting renewable and locally produced energy. This initiative not only aims to reduce energy dependence and environmental impact but also empowers citizens to become proactive participants in energy production, embodying the principles of energy sovereignty.
