# Decidim Barcelona

**Decidim.Barcelona**, leveraging the **[[Archive/00 Buffer - check later/Decidim]]** platform, exemplifies Barcelona's commitment to participatory democracy and ecosocial transition. Decidim, originating from Barcelona, stands as a beacon of open-source, community-driven development aimed at enhancing democratic processes across various sectors, including local governments and NGOs. Its framework supports strategic planning, participatory budgeting, and collaborative decision-making, embodying principles of transparency, integrity, and continuous improvement.

Through Decidim.Barcelona, the city harnesses this technology to engage citizens in shaping policies and initiatives for a sustainable urban future. The platform has facilitated significant projects like the Superblocks (superilles) program, reimagining urban spaces to prioritize green, pedestrian-friendly areas over vehicle traffic. This initiative demonstrates the platform's role in fostering community involvement in urban planning, directly contributing to the city's ecological and social wellbeing.

Furthermore, Decidim.Barcelona's application in scientific and university policy-making underscores its versatility in gathering public input on critical decisions. It serves as a vital tool for consulting the public on science policy actions, showcasing the platform's potential in democratizing policy-making processes, including those related to ecosocial transitions and sustainable development. Through Decidim.Barcelona, the city not only advances in digital democracy but also in promoting an inclusive approach to addressing urban and environmental challenges.
