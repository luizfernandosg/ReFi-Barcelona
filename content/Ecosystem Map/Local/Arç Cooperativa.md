# Arç Cooperativa

**Arç Cooperativa** is a pioneering cooperative insurance brokerage based in Barcelona, focused on ethical, solidarity-based insurance solutions. Their commitment aligns closely with the principles of ReFi through their dedication to social and ecological transformation, and their utilization of ethical financial practices that support sustainable development and community empowerment.

Founded in 1983 by individuals connected to social movements, environmentalism, and anti-capitalist left-wing national liberation movements, Arç Cooperativa operates with a deep commitment to cooperative values such as mutual aid, responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity, along with ethical values like honesty, transparency, social responsibility, and concern for others and the environment. These principles guide their operations, from the provision of insurance services to individuals, families, and organizations, to their specialized offerings in renewable energy sectors.

Arç distinguishes itself by integrating ethical and solidarity-based criteria into its insurance services, demonstrated by the management of over 7,500 policies with such criteria. They have also established significant collaborations with over sixty collectives from the associative world and the social and solidarity economy, reflecting their commitment to intercooperation and collective purchasing of insurance.

A key aspect of Arç's alignment with ReFi is their focus on fostering a fair, democratic, and ecological transition. They have identified areas of action based on proposals from the **[[Xarxa d'Economia Solidària (XES)|Solidarity Economy Network (XES)]]** to prioritize eco-social transition, cooperative innovation, and personal growth.

Arç's engagement with projects like Life eCOadapt50, aimed at adapting territories and economic activities to climate change impacts, illustrates their active role in addressing environmental challenges. This involvement signifies a broader commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, aligning with the goals of ReFi to leverage financial mechanisms for positive ecological and social outcomes.
