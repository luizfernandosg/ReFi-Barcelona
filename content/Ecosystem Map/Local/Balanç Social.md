# Balanç Social

The **Balanç Social** initiative, from the [[Xarxa d'Economia Solidària (XES)|Solidarity Economy Network (XES)]], is a tool for measuring the social, environmental impact, and good governance of organizations. It contributes to transparency and self-assessment, offering a spreadsheet with calculated responses and indicators to all participating organizations. 

Those surpassing the assessment by the Social Balance Commission receive a PDF document with calculated responses and indicators, a Social Balance seal, and an infographic highlighting the main results. 

This initiative underscores the importance of continuous evaluation and improvement, allowing entities to align more closely with the principles of the [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]].
