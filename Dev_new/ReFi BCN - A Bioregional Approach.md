# ReFi Barcelona: A Bioregional Approach

- The publishing of the BioFi book in 2024 and the emergence of its community has opened a new itersectional space between novel financial mechanisms and localy based practice and regenerative work.
- The aspect on focusing on how to establish financially infrastructures to bring global capital flows to localities (based bioregionally) has made it highly aligned with the field of ReFi (Regenerative Finance), and establishes and nourishes new articulations with groups that espouse the same values and principles - while implying them in practice in their bioregions, that is the space for truly regenerative work to be done.

ReFi BCN is currently in the process of being constituted as a cooperative (Catalan SCCL). The cooperative structure allows us to integrate a wide range of stakeholders with different backgrounds and expertise, that would allow us to support the impact/regeneration we want.

We see the emergence of the movement as an opportunity to:
1. Connect with local communities working with bioregionalism - being the enablers of regenerative ecosocial work
    - the point here is to bridge the gap to tangible work and impact. it is not ourselves (ReFi BCN) directly doing the work - it is ReFi BCN becoming a network that includes this regenerative work being done
2. Adopt a bioregional process for learning and dialoguing with local systems and communities
    - here we learn from their experience and from how they organize. for instance, we can learn from how cooperatives can be structured in a way that is regenerative and supportive of the bioregion.
3. Involve these key stakeholders in the process of constituting the cooperative - so that it can operate both as a node and a network, serving as the infrastructure to allow for the flows of resources, knowledge and support (in both/all directions).
4. Leverage the BioFi Framework to to guide the development of the cooperative into a Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF) - a new type of financial institution designed specifically to serve bioregional regeneration, leveraging both cooperative and DAO/Web3/ReFi forms.
5. Allow us to collaborate, learn and support bioregional initiatives in Catalunya, the wider Mediterranean region and beyond.


## What is a Bioregion and Bioregionalism?

A bioregion is a region defined by unique physical characteristics (climate, topography), ecological characteristics (such as soil, flora, fauna, and funga), cultural characteristics (such as language, art, and identity), and their interconnections. There are many differing definitions of the scale and boundaries of bioregions, and this diversity is celebrated as a critical insight about the lack of any firm boundaries in ecosystems and the need to work with neighbors in bioregional organizing.

Bioregionalism is a socio-political and ecological philosophy that argues for the organization of human societies based on natural ecological or biocultural regions, or "bioregions." It advocates for the alignment of economic activity, ecological management, and governance with the natural systems and cultures of the region. Bioregions can be seen as the natural units of place-based regeneration, enabling the interweaving of life's flows across species, the physical territory, and the cultural meanings of place. Bioregionalism suggests that the invisible and visible regenerative efforts occurring across multiple scales (individual, family, neighborhood, community, organization, ecoregion, global) can be anchored and organized in large, bioculturally coherent landscapes that federate through affinity, solidarity, and reciprocity to fulfill planetary potential.


## Why a Bioregional Approach for ReFi BCN? [WIP]

The bioregional approach emerges from the recognition that meaningful ecological regeneration requires going beyond our current boundaries. This approach allows ReFi BCN to address several fundamental challenges:

1. **Scale and Impact**: Individual organizations, even well-resourced ones, can rarely achieve significant ecosystem regeneration on their own. Bioregionalism provides a framework for coordinating efforts across multiple scales and actors.

2. **Connection to Land**: Many urban-based organizations lack direct articulation to the land and its ecological systems. A bioregional approach reconnects urban initiatives with their surrounding territories.

3. **Social Context Integration**: There's often a disconnection between financial and technological innovation hubs and the social contexts they aim to serve. Bioregionalism bridges this gap by emphasizing relationship-building with local communities and ecosystems.

4. **Systems Thinking**: Ecological challenges require systems-based solutions. Bioregionalism embodies systems thinking by recognizing the interconnectedness of ecological, economic, and cultural dimensions.

The cooperative structure allows us to connect and integrate a wide range of stakeholders with different backgrounds and expertise, that would allow us to support the impact/regeneration we want. These c

ReFi BCN needs to connect with its bioregion(s) to achieve significant impact.

### Creating Roots in the Territory [WIP]

For ReFi BCN to be effective, we must establish deep relationships within our bioregion—the Catalan territory with its unique ecological and cultural characteristics. This means:

1. **Building a Network of Mutual Support**: Like the mycorrhizal networks in healthy forest ecosystems, we aim to create reciprocal relationships with existing initiatives throughout Catalonia. These relationships facilitate the flow of resources, knowledge, and support in all directions.

2. **Mapping the Ecosystem**: We're conducting comprehensive mapping of existing regenerative initiatives in the territory, identifying key nodes, resources, and needs. This mapping process follows the bioregional mapping principles outlined in the BioFi framework.

3. **Infrastructure for Collaboration**: Our cooperative structure serves as organizational mycelium, creating the infrastructure needed for effective collaboration across diverse stakeholders and projects.

4. **Leveraging Existing Knowledge**: Rather than reinventing the wheel, we're building on Catalonia's rich tradition of cooperativism, bioregionalism, ecosocial transition, and degrowth thinking—fields where local actors have developed significant expertise.

5. **Forming Strategic Partnerships**: We're establishing formal agreements with established projects working in various parts of the Catalan bioregion, ensuring that our urban node remains connected to on-the-ground regenerative work.

This territorial rootedness allows us to function not just as a standalone entity but as part of a living ecosystem of regenerative initiatives, creating what the BioFi framework calls "islands of coherence" within the broader bioregional context.


We recognize that if we want to achieve significant impact and systemic transformation, we need to think beyond our current boundaries.

- establish a network of mutual support and collaboration

- Our bioregional approach focuses on establishing deep reciprocal relationships that mirror mycorrhizal networks in healthy ecosystems. 

- We want to
    - connect with existing initiatives, research regenerative practices, 
    - provide infrastructure for collaboration, and leverage our cooperative structure to create formal connections with local projects.
    - Access to funding, knowledge and networks from ReFi BCN

- We aim to partner with established projects working in the territory

- This network allows us to build on existing knowledge in fields related to ecosocial bioregionalism, ecosocial transition, and degrowth.

- We believe that the only way is to collaborate, and not to work on silos.

### Bridging Divides

Our approach recognizes the symbiotic relationship between different contexts, creating fractal connections across different scales and environments:

1. **Urban and Rural Contexts**: ReFi BCN sits at the interface between Barcelona's urban innovation ecosystem and rural regenerative initiatives throughout Catalonia. We recognize that healthy bioregions require vibrant exchanges between urban and rural settings, with resources, knowledge, and people flowing in both directions.

2. **Global and Local Systems**: We connect global networks and knowledge with place-based implementation, translating universal principles into locally appropriate practices. This allows us to bring global resources to local contexts while ensuring that solutions remain adapted to specific ecological and cultural conditions.

3. **ReFi/Web3 and Traditional Regenerative Work**: We bridge the technological innovation of ReFi and Web3 with on-the-ground regenerative projects. This creates opportunities for novel financing mechanisms to support tangible ecological restoration and community development.

In ecology, the most productive and biodiverse zones are often found at the boundaries between two distinct ecosystems—these transition areas are called ecotones. ReFi Barcelona positions itself as a deliberate ecotone between multiple contexts—creating productive interfaces where distinct social, economic, and ecological systems can interact, exchange, and co-evolve.

By functioning as both a node and a network, ReFi BCN facilitates the flow of resources, knowledge, and support in multiple directions, strengthening the overall bioregional ecosystem and creating what the BioFi framework calls "cascading benefits" throughout the system.

## The Cooperative Structure as an Enabler

ReFi BCN's cooperative structure serves as the organizational mycelium of our bioregional approach, blending traditional cooperative models with emerging decentralized governance. This hybrid structure positions us as a unique mediator between traditional social economy organizations and new decentralized approaches.

The multi-stakeholder cooperative model functions as our "organizational mycelium"—a living structure that provides both stability and adaptability, connecting diverse participants while maintaining alignment with our regenerative purpose. It enables:

1. **Democratic Governance**: The cooperative structure ensures one member, one vote, distributing power democratically among participants. This mirrors natural ecosystems where resilience emerges from distributed, rather than centralized, structures.

2. **Multi-stakeholder Integration**: Our cooperative includes different types of members—individual contributors, project representatives, network partners, and supporters—creating an internal ecosystem as diverse as the natural systems we aim to regenerate.

3. **Legal Recognition and Local Resonance**: The cooperative form is well-established in Spanish and Catalan law and resonates with the strong cooperative tradition in our region. This local alignment is essential for bioregional work.

4. **Shared Ownership**: Members collectively own the cooperative, creating alignment of interests and a sense of shared stewardship that parallels ecological principles of interdependence.

5. **Bioregional Enabler**: The structure serves as connective tissue between urban innovation and rural regeneration efforts, facilitating flows of resources, knowledge, and support across the bioregion.

While embracing the cooperative legal structure, we're also incorporating decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) elements to enhance our operations with transparent decision-making, token-based incentives, global connectivity, and fractal governance structures.


## Collaborating in Wider Bioregions and Networks

While our primary focus is the Catalan bioregion, we recognize the value of participating in larger bioregional networks and the importance of cross-bioregional collaboration. Bioregions themselves don't exist in isolation—they're connected through watersheds, species migrations, cultural exchanges, and economic flows.

ReFi BCN is actively engaged with:

1. **ReFi Mediterranean**: We're a founding node in this network of ReFi initiatives across the Mediterranean bioregion. This collaboration recognizes the ecological and cultural connections that transcend national borders, creating opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaborative funding.

2. **Global BioFi Community**: We're participating in the global community of practice around the BioFi framework, sharing learnings and receiving guidance from other bioregional finance practitioners worldwide.

3. **Regenerative Communities Network**: Connecting with other place-based regenerative initiatives to exchange best practices and create solidarity between bioregions.

These collaborations enable what the BioFi framework calls "fractal" organization—similar patterns of regenerative practice repeating at different scales, from the local to the bioregional to the global. By participating in these wider networks, we ensure that our local work contributes to and benefits from regenerative efforts at larger scales.


## Flow Funding and Resource Allocation

Central to our bioregional approach is facilitating the efficient and equitable flow of resources. We're developing several mechanisms to enable these flows:

1. **Quadratic Funding**: Implementing this mechanism allows us to amplify community support for projects, giving greater weight to initiatives with broad grassroots backing rather than just those with a few large supporters.

2. **Flow Funding**: Decentralizing funding decisions by empowering community members to allocate resources based on their direct knowledge of local needs and opportunities.

3. **Participatory Budgeting**: Using cooperative governance to make collaborative decisions about resource allocation, ensuring diverse perspectives inform our funding strategies.

4. **Inter-bioregional Resource Flows**: Through our collaboration with ReFi Mediterranean, we've already implemented innovative funding mechanisms that allow resources to flow between bioregions based on need and opportunity.

5. **Multi-capital Exchanges**: Beyond financial resources, we're facilitating the exchange of other forms of capital—social, intellectual, experiential, cultural—recognizing that regeneration requires more than just money.

These approaches align with the BioFi framework's emphasis on democratizing financial decisions and ensuring that resource flows strengthen rather than extract from local communities and ecosystems.

## Building a Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)

Our ultimate vision is for ReFi BCN to evolve into a Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)—a concept from the BioFi framework that describes a community-owned institution that applies a participatory, transparent, and place-based approach to driving the decentralization of financial resource governance.

As defined by the BioFi framework, a BFF "specializes in facilitating the flow of financial capital between regenerative projects, community members, and investors, [while also working] in close relationship with a Bioregional Hub to facilitate the flow of all capital types (e.g., social, intellectual, cultural) in holistic support of bioregional regeneration."

By aligning with this framework, we aim to:

1. **Create Financial Infrastructure for Regeneration**: Establishing the mechanisms and relationships needed to direct financial resources toward systemic regeneration in Catalonia.

2. **Design Project Portfolios for Systemic Change**: Moving beyond isolated projects to support interconnected initiatives that collectively transform systems.

3. **Facilitate Bioregional Investment**: Creating pathways for both local and global capital to support regenerative work in the Catalan bioregion.

4. **Connect Financial and Non-financial Capitals**: Recognizing that true wealth includes multiple forms of capital beyond just financial resources.

5. **Ground Resource Allocation in Local Context**: Ensuring that funding decisions reflect the specific ecological, cultural, and social characteristics of our bioregion.

This evolution will position ReFi BCN as the connective tissue between financial resources and on-the-ground regenerators in Catalonia, playing a crucial role in the transition to a regenerative economy.

## Conclusion: A Living Systems Approach to Organization

ReFi BCN's bioregional approach represents a comprehensive strategy for bridging global ReFi networks with local regenerative initiatives, urban innovation with rural regeneration, and traditional cooperative structures with emerging decentralized models—all in service of creating a more resilient, regenerative Catalonia.

By consciously designing our organization to mirror the patterns and principles of living systems, we create what the BioFi framework calls "organizational mycelium"—adaptive, responsive structures that facilitate the flow of resources, knowledge, and support throughout the bioregion.

This approach recognizes that true regeneration emerges not from isolated interventions but from the cultivation of healthy relationships between diverse actors in a bioregion. Like a forest ecosystem where trees, fungi, animals, and microorganisms create complex webs of mutual support, ReFi BCN aims to facilitate the emergence of regenerative patterns across the Catalan territory.

Through this bioregional lens, we see our work not as creating a single organization but as nurturing an ecosystem—one where diverse initiatives can thrive, connect, and collectively contribute to the health and vitality of our shared home.
