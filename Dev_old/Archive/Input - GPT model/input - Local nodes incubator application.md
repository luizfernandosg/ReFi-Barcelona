The city, and Catalonia in general, has a rich history and actuality of support to progressive initiatives. Public institutions such as the Ajuntament de Barcelona (city council) has had a big focus on positive social & ecological change, with active initiatives addressing urban regeneration, waste management and climate change - being reference in many of these.

Barcelona, as a densely populated urban center, faces a unique set of challenges stemming from its status as a bustling metropolis and the impacts of over-tourism. The city's social fabric has undergone transformations due to increased tourism, which has at times strained local resources and community cohesion.

AKASHA Hub has a deep alignment with the ReFi ecosystem and has been supporting the ReFi BCN initiative since its inception.

**Giveth** has had a strong presence in the city with a physical space used by contributors of the Giveth Galaxy - Giveth, Commons Stack, TEC, General Magic, ‚Ä¶ - and close people.

**Plastiks** is a prominent ReFi project based in Barcelona that has already gotten some good traction and awareness, specially more recently with its partnership with FC Barcelona.

Other noteworthy web3 projects from in and around Barcelona are:
