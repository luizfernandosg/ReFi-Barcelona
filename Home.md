## What is ReFi BCN?

ReFi BCN aims to illuminate and explore these areas and connection opportunities.

ReFi Barcelona is a local node of ReFi DAO - a decentralized community (and soon to be truly a DAO) working on promoting and facilitating the development of the ReFi ecosystem.

ReFi BCN is a community working on that locally, in Barcelona. Our focus is on bridging the gap between value-aligned groups and individuals in Barcelona and the broader ReFi ecosystem. We aim to facilitate the integration of innovative tech and ideas of ReFi with the vibrant landscape of ecological and social positive-impact work already underway in Barcelona. 

We are weaving the threads of the futures we would like to see - *regenerative futures*.

We want to explore how finance - something that has historically driven exploitation and degradation - could be leveraged as a drive for positive change. We believe that the same mechanisms that have led to our current global challenges could be repurposed to drive a regenerative and just transformation.

## Knowledge base & Ecosystem map

We see information as the foundation for building any of these bridges. Being so, that's the layer we're tackling first - here and now -; in this very medium - the [[ReFi BCN Knowledge Base]], that doubles as its website.

We're compiling here an [[ecosystem map]] highlighting the fields we want to explore with ReFi BCN. With this initiative we want to bring to light both the local thriving value-aligned movements of Barcelona, such as the cooperative, and global communities and tech-enablers, such as ReFi and Web3.

We want our efforts to mediate positive action on the ground, locally - but not limited to 'our local'. We embrace an open-source ethos, believing that transparency and collaboration are key to our collective growth and impact. This website and knowledge base are designed to be shared and adapted, inviting other local nodes and groups to engage with and expand upon our work.

Learn more about the [[ReFi BCN Knowledge Base]], and feel free to fork it to apply in your own context.
