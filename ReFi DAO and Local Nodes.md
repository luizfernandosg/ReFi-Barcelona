# ReFi DAO and Local Nodes - WIP

ReFi DAO is a decentralized community (and soon to be truly a DAO) working on promoting and facilitating the development of the ReFi ecosystem.

## Mission, Vision and Values

ReFi DAOâ€™s core mission is focused on developing strategic services and public goods for the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) ecosystem including movement-wide sense-making, education, opportunity development, fundraising support, onboarding and empowerment through a blend of online platforms, multimedia, and community coordination. 

Central to our work is incubating and supporting the development of ReFi Local Nodes across all major regions in the world. These local communities are pivotal in championing ReFi solutions on the ground and enacting a cosmo-local network for the regenerative economy.
