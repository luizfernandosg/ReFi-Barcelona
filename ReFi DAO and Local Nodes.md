# ReFi DAO and Local Nodes - WIP

ReFi DAO represents a decentralized community, evolving towards a fully realized DAO, committed to nurturing and accelerating the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) ecosystem. Its efforts are geared towards creating a global network of local nodes, each contributing uniquely to this transformative movement.

## Mission, Vision, and Values

ReFi DAO's mission encompasses developing strategic services and public goods for the ReFi ecosystem. This includes wide-ranging activities like movement-wide sense-making, education, opportunity development, fundraising support, onboarding, and empowerment through diverse platforms, including online interfaces, multimedia, and community coordination. At the heart of these endeavors is the incubation and support of ReFi Local Nodes worldwide, fostering a cosmo-local network for a regenerative economy.

## The Role of Local Nodes

ReFi DAO is actively building a decentralized network of regionally-based local communities, each sharing the mission to regenerate the Earth using contemporary tools. These Local Nodes, envisioned as autonomous yet interconnected local impact DAOs, begin with simple meet-ups and events and may evolve to acquire land and other real-world assets. This progression aims to nurture locally-based regenerative economies and communities【19†source】.

### Local Node Prize and Incubator Program

ReFi DAO, in collaboration with Commons Stack, has launched a prize to incubate the first ReFi DAO Local Node in the Global South, alongside a Node in Lisbon. This initiative seeks a city in the Global South to join the Alpha Cohort of the Local Node Incubator. The program guides Prize winners through deploying their Local Node, including collective fund-raising, token economy design, governance establishment, token launch, and proposal passing. ReFi DAO and Commons Stack offer comprehensive support throughout this process, with Local Nodes representing a foundational element in the network state architecture explored by ReFi DAO【20†source】.

### Activities and Events

Local Nodes participate in a Gitcoin Beta subset round, raising funds for community gathering and local events, supported by ReFi Event Organizers Guild and ReFi Spring. These activities aim to cultivate shared visions of regeneration and form core teams competing for the Local Node Prize【20†source】.

### Criteria for a Successful Application

For a successful Local Node application, certain criteria must be met. These include a commitment from experienced founders, a detailed vision for city regeneration, identification of key local partners, and a detailed budget for 24 months【20†source】.

## ReFi DAO's Broader Activities

ReFi DAO is also involved in various other initiatives, as evidenced by their activities and publications on their Mirror platform. These include strategic overviews of regeneration, explorations of the role of Web3 in driving innovation and problem-solving, and recaps of key moments and organizations in the ReFi movement【21†source】.

In summary, ReFi DAO's Local Nodes are more than just community hubs; they are integral to the DAO's vision of a globally coordinated, locally enacted regenerative economy. These nodes are pivotal in translating the ReFi ethos into tangible, on-the-ground action and impact.
