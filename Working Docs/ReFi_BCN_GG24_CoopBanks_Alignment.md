# Alignment with Cooperative Banking Values and Programs

## How ReFi Barcelona's GG24 Round Complements Existing Cooperative Banking Initiatives

---

### Cooperative Banks' Current Grant Programs

Many cooperative banks in Catalonia already operate grant and social investment programs:

- **Coop57's Social Projects Fund**: Annual allocation for social transformation projects
- **Fiare's Ethical Banking Projects**: Support for solidarity economy initiatives
- **Caixa d'Enginyers Foundation**: Environmental and social innovation grants

### How Quadratic Funding Enhances These Programs

1. **Democratic Decision-Making**
   - Aligns perfectly with cooperative principles of democratic participation
   - Community members decide funding priorities, not just internal committees
   - One person, one vote principle extended to funding decisions

2. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - All transactions and decisions are publicly verifiable
   - Real-time tracking of fund distribution
   - Automated impact reporting reduces administrative burden

3. **Multiplier Effect**
   - Bank's contribution is matched by international funds
   - €10,000 from a coop bank could become €30,000 in total funding
   - More impact without increasing internal budget

4. **Innovation Laboratory**
   - Test new participatory finance models
   - Learn about emerging technologies in a controlled environment
   - Position as leaders in financial innovation for social good

### Specific Benefits for Each Stakeholder

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Proven Track Record**: The model has been successfully tested in GG23
2. **Local Control**: Evaluation criteria can be customized for Catalan context
3. **Technical Support**: ReFi BCN handles all technical aspects
4. **Gradual Approach**: Start with smaller amounts to test the model

### Comparison with Traditional Grant-Making

| Traditional Grants | Quadratic Funding |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Top-down selection | Community-driven |
| Fixed evaluation committee | Open participation |
| Limited transparency | Full transparency |
| Single funding source | Multiple matched sources |
| Annual cycles | Flexible timing |

### Success Metrics

We propose tracking:
- Number of projects funded
- Geographic distribution across Catalonia
- Environmental impact metrics (CO2 reduced, land regenerated, etc.)
- Community engagement (number of donors, average donation size)
- Fund multiplication ratio (local vs. matched funds)

### Integration with Existing Programs

This initiative can:
- Complement existing grant programs, not replace them
- Serve as a pilot for future innovation
- Provide data and insights for improving traditional programs
- Create synergies between local and global funding sources
