# ReFi Barcelona GG24 Round

### *Finan√ßament Participatiu per a la Regeneraci√≥ de Catalunya*

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Who We Are - ReFi BCN

**ReFi Barcelona** is a collective building bridges between global regenerative finance and local ecosocial transition initiatives in Catalonia. We are an emerging cooperative (in formation with support from Co√≤polis) that integrates innovative Web3 technologies with the Social and Solidarity Economy.

Our mission is to **strengthen environmental and social regeneration projects** in Catalonia, connecting them with new funding sources and organizational models based on transparency, collaboration, and verifiable impact.

### 1.2. What We're Proposing

We propose organizing **Catalonia's first participatory Quadratic Funding round** dedicated to bioregional regeneration projects, uniting local and global funding sources through innovative Web3 technology.

**Key Features:**
- **Distribute funds democratically** to local impact projects
- **Multiply local donations** with additional matching funds
- **Empower the community** to decide which projects receive more support
- **Create total transparency** in the funding process

## 2. Context

### 2.1. What is Quadratic Funding?

**Quadratic Funding** is an innovative resource distribution mechanism that:

- **Prioritizes citizen participation**: Every donation counts, regardless of amount
- **Amplifies small donations**: A project with 100 donations of ‚Ç¨5 receives more additional funds than one with 1 donation of ‚Ç¨500
- **Promotes diversity**: Rewards projects with broad community support
- **Is transparent**: The entire process is public and auditable

### 2.2. How Quadratic Funding Enhances Traditional Grant Programs

| Traditional Grants | Quadratic Funding |
|---|---|
| Top-down selection | Community-driven |
| Fixed evaluation committee | Open participation |
| Limited transparency | Full transparency |
| Single funding source | Multiple matched sources |
| Annual cycles | Flexible timing |

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Democratic Decision-Making**
   - Aligns with cooperative principles of democratic participation
   - Community members decide funding priorities
   - One person, one vote principle extended to funding decisions

2. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - All transactions and decisions are publicly verifiable
   - Real-time tracking of fund distribution
   - Automated impact reporting reduces administrative burden

3. **Multiplier Effect**
   - Local contributions are matched by international funds
   - ‚Ç¨10,000 from local sources could become ‚Ç¨30,000 in total funding
   - More impact without increasing local investment

4. **Innovation Laboratory**
   - Test new participatory finance models
   - Learn about emerging technologies in a controlled environment
   - Position as leaders in financial innovation for social good

### 2.3. Our Track Record with Regen Coordination

During 2025, ReFi Barcelona has actively participated in the global **Regen Coordination** program, which has distributed over **$159,732** (approximately ‚Ç¨150,000) to regenerative projects worldwide.

**GG23 Global Round Highlights:**
- **50 projects** funded globally
- **579 unique donors** participating
- **$96,000** in matching funds distributed
- First successful implementation of **ImpactQF** model (funding based on verified impact)

### 2.4. Examples of Successful Localized Rounds

The GG24 localized round for Catalunya builds upon a growing movement of place-based regenerative funding experiments. Each previous round has contributed unique innovations to the evolving model of bioregional quadratic funding.

**ReFi Mediterranean GG23: AI-Enhanced Impact Evaluation**

The first localized round to implement **AI-driven ImpactQF methodology**, combining traditional quadratic funding with artificial intelligence evaluation. 50% of matching funds allocated based on AI-assessed impact scores, 50% on community support. Supported 12 projects in the Mediterranean bioregion with **$10,000** distributed.

**Zazelenimo Split: Municipal Government Integration**

Groundbreaking **integration of quadratic funding into municipal governance** in Split, Croatia. The city allocated **‚Ç¨50,000 from municipal budget** for green space improvements through Web3 participatory budgeting, proving blockchain-based democratic funding can operate within government structures.

**Regen Rio de Janeiro: Cultural and Regional Identity**

Brazil's first quadratic funding initiative focused on regional impact, emphasizing **cyber-cultural facilitation** and Portuguese-language resources. Demonstrated how regenerative finance can honor local traditions while introducing innovative funding mechanisms through the Regenerative Resources Protocol.

**Ma Earth: Land-Focused Specialization**

**$200,000 matching pool** specialized in regenerative land projects, creating evaluation frameworks specifically for measuring ecological outcomes. Demonstrated how thematic specialization attracts targeted expertise and creates nuanced impact assessment methodologies.

**Regen Coordination Global: AI-Enhanced Impact Measurement**

Pioneered **AI integration into quadratic funding evaluation** using GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 models. 579 unique donors supported 50 projects with $96,000 distributed, establishing the Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS) for structured, machine-readable impact data at scale.

## 3. Our Plan for Catalunya

### 3.1. Vision

Create a **Catalan regenerative funding ecosystem** that combines:
- **Local resources** (cooperative banks, foundations, administrations)
- **International support** (Celo, Gitcoin, ReFi DAO)
- **Active citizen participation** through democratic funding mechanisms

We're connected to global networks of funders, blockchain ecosystems, and Web3 programs for fundraising and distributing funds. Our goal is to bring together local and global capital to pilot these new mechanisms for funding public goods and regenerative work in Catalunya.

### 3.2. How It Will Work

```
