# ReFi Barcelona

ReFi Barcelona is a collective dedicated to integrating the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement with Barcelona's vibrant local context. Our mission is to build bridges - between global movements and local actions, financial innovation and positive social impact, and between technology and actionable change.

**Our Mission**

To facilitate and mediate connections and actions that drive the transformative change we want to see. We aim to build bridges between the ReFi movement and the local context of Barcelona, bridging the global and the local, financial incentives and positive action, coops & Web3, tech and action, and the future with the present.

**What is ReFi BCN?**

ReFi Barcelona is a collective at the forefront of bridging global movements and infrastructure—like the ReFi (Regenerative Finance), CoFi (Collaborative Finance), Web3, and other decentralized technologies—with local groups driving the ecosocial transition. This includes the thriving Cooperative Landscape and Social Economy in Barcelona and Catalonia, and the Degrowth movement.

We pinpoint pivotal leverage points, connecting the local with the global, to foster the changes we want to see, exploring how finance, traditionally a driver of exploitation, can be repurposed for regenerative and just transformation.

We want to explore how finance - something that has historically driven exploitation and degradation - could be leveraged as a drive for positive change. We believe that the same mechanisms that have led to our current global challenges could be collectively repurposed to drive a regenerative and just transformation.
