It focuses on acquiring and lending housing for community projects, stewarding productive lands, and promoting shared tools useful for rural life. The foundation is built on fostering access to resources, production, and relationships based on cooperation for the common good, aiming to break away from dominant individualistic dynamics. It places emphasis on addressing the needs, capacities, and potentials of the rural world and its natural surroundings, as opposed to the prevailing urban-centric culture.
