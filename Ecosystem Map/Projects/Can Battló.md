**Can Batlló** is a vibrant, community-managed space located in the La Bordeta neighborhood of Barcelona, embodying the principles of ReFi through its commitment to social and ecological sustainability. This expansive area, once a textile factory, has transformed into a hub for cultural, educational, and environmental initiatives, driven by the collective effort of local residents and beyond.

Some notable projects include:

- **La Cantina Lab**: A cooperative bar and restaurant that emphasizes quality, locally-sourced food, prepared with care by specialized professionals. This initiative underscores a commitment to environmental sustainability, offering a variety of healthy, seasonal food options, including vegan and vegetarian choices.
- **Community Gardens and Orchards**: Spanning 1200 m², these green spaces are self-managed by the community within Can Batlló. Established with the goal of creating a sustainable and socially inclusive environment, these gardens serve as a pedagogical tool for exchanging knowledge on sustainable food production and environmental stewardship. They are open to the broader community, prioritizing participation from socially vulnerable groups and providing adapted gardening spaces for individuals with limited mobility.
- **Biblioteca Popular Josep Pons**: An autonomously managed library named in honor of a local activist, offering lending services, Wi-Fi access, reading and study areas, and a children's space. The library's collection, largely sourced from donations, includes significant feminist, LGBTI, and queer documentary resources, serving as a city-wide reference for related contents. This space exemplifies the community's commitment to knowledge sharing and cultural activities.

The focus on environmental stewardship, social cohesion, and cultural enrichment aligns closely with ReFi's objectives. Can Batlló acts as a living example of how local initiatives can embody the values of regenerative finance, promoting a more sustainable and equitable future through collective action and community empowerment.
