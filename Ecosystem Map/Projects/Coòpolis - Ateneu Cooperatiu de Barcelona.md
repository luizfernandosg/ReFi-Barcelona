**Coòpolis - Ateneu Cooperatiu de Barcelona** -, serves as a pivotal hub for the promotion and development of the [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE)]] within Barcelona. As part of the [[Xarxa d’Ateneus Cooperatius de Catalunya]] (Catalonia Cooperative Ateneus Network), its primary focus is on fostering new cooperatives and creating job opportunities within existing ones. Situated in the [[Can Batlló]] community complex, Coòpolis is dedicated to nurturing a socio-economic and educational ecosystem that generates employment and has a social impact. It acts as a laboratory for inter-cooperation and local economic strengthening, aiming to build cooperative cities as new territories for economic, social, and solidarity cooperation.

Coòpolis has a rich history that underscores its commitment to technical solvency, social and environmental sustainability, and positive territorial impact. The platform's inception was based on community participation, emphasizing the need for facilities that generate economic activity and employment to tackle the challenges faced by the working class. This initiative aligns with [[Can Batlló]]'s historical productive function and the cooperative dynamism of the [[Sants]] neighborhood, ultimately leading to the formation of Coòpolis as a promoter group. The collaboration between the District of Sants-Montjuïc, [[Barcelona Activa]], and local cooperatives facilitated the development of Coòpolis into a socio-economic promotion facility focused on the training, incubation of cooperatives, and promotion of the SSE.

In alignment with ReFi (Regenerative Finance) principles, Coòpolis has embarked on projects such as the HuCoTEB (Hub Cooperatiu per la Transició Energètica de Barcelona), which aims to create a cooperative hub for energy transition in Barcelona. This project, supported by entities with extensive experience in energy and the SSE, aims to become a reference center in the field of energy transition towards more efficient and sustainable models. The HuCoTEB is envisioned as both a physical and virtual metropolitan space linked to Coòpolis, facilitating innovation in the sector and serving as a catalyst for companies. This initiative underscores Coòpolis's commitment to regenerative and sustainable practices through the cooperative model, integrating the principles of ReFi by fostering decentralized, community-led solutions for energy transition.

Coòpolis’s activities and its foundational ethos are deeply connected to Barcelona's identity, reflecting the city's rich cooperative movement and commitment to social, environmental, and economic sustainability.
