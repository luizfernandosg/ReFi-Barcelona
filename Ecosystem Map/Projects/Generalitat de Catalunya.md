**Generalitat de Catalunya** is the autonomous government of Catalonia, pivotal in shaping the region's legislative, executive, and judicial landscape.

With roots stretching back to the 12th century, this institution embodies Catalonia's rich historical and cultural heritage, while actively steering contemporary socio-political, economic, and environmental policies. It plays a crucial role in advancing Catalonia's autonomy, addressing its challenges within the framework of the Spanish Constitution and the Statute of Autonomy. 

For the ReFi Barcelona, the Generalitat's initiatives in environmental sustainability, innovation, and economic development are of particular significance, offering a dynamic backdrop for the implementation and success of ReFi projects aimed at fostering ecological and financial regeneration in the region.
