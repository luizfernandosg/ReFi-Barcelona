**Grup Cooperatiu Ecos**, established in 2011, stands as a collective of cooperatives aiming to provide an alternative to the current socio-economic model through the principles of the social and solidarity economy. Based in Barcelona, Ecos focuses on strengthening and developing its member cooperatives, enhancing the well-being of their members and the community, and promoting the creation of a social market. The cooperative fosters inter-cooperation among its members and with other entities, participating in the sectorial and territorial articulation of the social and solidarity economy, thus strengthening networks and second-degree entities.

Ecos is composed of diverse cooperatives, including [[Arç Cooperativa]], Calidoscoop, Celobert Arquitectura, Enginyeria i Urbanisme, and many others, collectively employing a significant number of individuals and serving thousands of consumer members. The group is involved in various sectors, aiming to create mutual support systems, collective investment, and share projects and learnings that have social and environmental responsibility at their core.

Ecos's commitment to transparency and democratic management is reflected in its annual [[Balanç Social|Social Balance]], part of the [[Xarxa d'Economia Solidària (XES)|Solidarity Economy Network (XES)]], measuring its social, environmental impact, and internal democracy and equality. The group and its cooperatives are also members of [[Coop 57]], further aligning with the broader cooperative and ethical finance community.

Located at Carrer Casp, 43 in Barcelona, the group provides a space for cooperatives and associations working within the social solidarity economy, embodying the values of trust, transparency, democracy, equality, self-organization, and solidarity. Ecos places people at the center of its actions, contributing to social transformation and actively seeking new members to expand its impact.

Ecos's initiatives demonstrate a strong alignment with ReFi principles by utilizing collective action and mutual support to drive positive social and ecological outcomes. Its foundational values and objectives closely mirror the ethos of ReFi - promoting economic systems that prioritize community well-being, environmental sustainability, and equitable growth.
