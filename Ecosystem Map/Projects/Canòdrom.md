The **Canòdrom**, formally known as the Canòdrom - Ateneu d’Innovació Digital i Democràtica, is a unique space in Barcelona that serves as a citizen lab focused on technology and democracy. 

It serves as a meeting point for continuous learning and exchange on digital society challenges through a variety of cultural activities and specialized training sessions. The institution is committed to democratizing technology, offering an open, participatory space for research groups, activists, and tech projects to reflect on the digital era's challenges.

Canòdrom aims to make technology more accessible to people, serving as a hub for continuous learning, knowledge exchange, and self-learning on the challenges of the digital society and emerging technologies. The Canòdrom School offers training and workshops to bridge the digital divide, providing tools and knowledge on open technologies as alternatives to those offered by large tech companies.

Through its residency program, the Canòdrom supports collaborative workspaces for projects focusing on technology, science, and democracy, aiming to stimulate collective creation and become a benchmark in these fields. This program promotes community-focused innovative projects, especially within its local neighborhood and the broader Barcelona area.

This alignment with democratic, open-source principles and a focus on sustainability and social innovation indicates a strong potential alignment with ReFi.
