**Mas Les Vinyies** is a community project and permaculture farm in El Moian√®s, in the province of Barcelona, emphasizing intensive design and work to create spaces requiring minimal intervention. It is part of the Iberian Permaculture network since 2015 and a Permaculture Demonstration Center since 2018, committed to reducing emissions and increasing carbon capture in food production processes. The project rejects non-reusable and non-compostable materials. This connection to Barcelona and the broader regenerative finance movement showcases a proactive approach to living in a post-collapse scenario, focusing on local, seasonal eating, water conservation, community living, and adapting to natural rhythms.

It aligns with regenerative principles by fostering ecological and social resilience through decentralized, sustainable practices.
