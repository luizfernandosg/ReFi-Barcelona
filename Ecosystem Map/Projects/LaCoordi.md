**LaCoordi** is an initiative that fosters public commitment to a globally just and sustainable economic model through projects like "Ciutats pel Comer√ß Just" (Fair Trade Towns). This project promotes Fair Trade and social justice principles across municipalities, engaging public sectors, businesses, schools, and community groups. It connects small producer groups with citizens, enhancing global and sustainable justice. 

LaCoordi's efforts align with ReFi by advocating for systemic change in economic practices towards more equitable and sustainable models.
