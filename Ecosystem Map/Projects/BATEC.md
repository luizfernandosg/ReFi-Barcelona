**BATEC** - Pol Cooperatiu per la Transició Energètica, based in Barcelona, is a collaborative project uniting cooperatives and associations to lead an energy transition towards a model that is sustainable, equitable, and governed democratically, originating from the [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]] sector. 

It advocates for an energy model that prioritizes environmental care, social justice, and economic democracy to facilitate holistic social change, balancing nature and societal needs. The strategy emphasizes reducing energy demand first, then integrating locally managed, distributed renewable energies to achieve energy sovereignty.

BATEC seeks to build and strengthen alliances within the [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]] to push forward this new energy model, collaborating with entities like [[Aiguasol]], SEBA, Lacol, and others.

BATEC's initiatives, such as resilient schools, energy self-sufficient agriculture, and the Energy Community of Bon Pastor, showcase its dedication to the eco-social energy transition, promoting sustainability, and establishing energy and resource communities. A significant focus is on rural energy transition through [CER.COOP](http://cer.coop/), enhancing cooperative energy generation and consumption.

**Aligned with ReFi's ethos**, BATEC aims to revamp the socio-economic landscape through an eco-social transition, focusing on sustainable, democratic, and just energy solutions. Its efforts reflect a localized commitment to advancing sustainable and equitable energy practices.
