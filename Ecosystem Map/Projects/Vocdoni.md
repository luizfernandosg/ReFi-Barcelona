**Vocdoni** is a pioneering web3 digital voting platform. Its framework is designed to enhance accessibility, transparency, and security in voting systems, leveraging the strengths of decentralized technology to ensure that voting processes are not only secure but also universally verifiable and resistant to censorship.

Vocdoni has made significant strides in bridging the gap between traditional (Web2) and blockchain-based (Web3) technologies, aiming to make its digital voting infrastructure as user-friendly as Web2 applications while harnessing the security, transparency, and decentralization of Web3. This approach has allowed Vocdoni to deploy its voting solutions across a variety of sectors, including sports clubs such as Barcelona Football Club.

The platform allows groups to decide the level of privacy for their voters, from public to anonymous. By using mechanisms such as zkSNARKs and blind signatures, Vocdoni ensures that no personal information is uploaded onto the blockchain, thereby protecting voter privacy.
