**Coop57** stands as a beacon for ethical and solidarity-based financial services, deeply rooted in the transformative and collective economic models aimed at societal betterment. Established in 1987, its core mission revolves around converting savings into transformative credit. This approach assists projects that add significant value to society by providing them with the necessary financial support to continue their impactful work.

Coop57 actively fosters the auto-organization of cooperatives and other social economy entities with a democratic and participative structure. **This approach is in harmony with ReFi's objectives** to decentralize power and resources, ensuring a fairer distribution and access to financial services. Moreover, Coop57's dedication to ethical and solidarity finances, based on coherence, participation, solidarity, cooperation, and innovation, mirrors ReFi's innovative use of technology to address social and ecological challenges

Coop57's headquarters in Barcelona serve as a hub for catalyzing the transformation of the local economy towards more sustainable and equitable practices. The cooperative's structure, with territorial sections, facilitates close relationships with local partners, making it an integral part of the city's ecosystem of social innovation and economic transformation.

Coop57's work in network with other entities, networks, and federations articulates strategies for the joint construction of the social and solidarity economy. This collaborative spirit enhances the creation of a social market for an integral and alternative construction of the economic cycle within the logic of the social and solidarity economy. 

Projects supported by Coop57 showcase its commitment to social and ecological transformation through financial mechanisms that prioritize just ecological transition, energy transition, and community support.
