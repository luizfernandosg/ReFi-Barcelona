**Colectic** is a non-profit cooperative based in Barcelona, rooted in social innovation and transformation through the strategic use of technology. Originating in 2014, Colectic has been evolving with the aim of fostering an alternative economic system centered around people, care, the environment, and social impact, reflecting its internal governance model characterized by horizontality, self-management, and assembly-based decision-making.

The cooperative's commitment to social transformation is evident in its wide range of projects. These include initiatives like "Passa't al FLOSS," promoting free and open-source software, "STEAMOnEdu," focusing on STEM education, "Cocrea" for open and community science, and "Vincles BCN," which targets social innovation and elderly care. Other notable projects include "CODINC" for coding inclusion, training programs on "Communication and Solidarity Economy" with [[Barcelona Activa]], and "CoAgenda," an advocate for socio-economic innovation and the social and solidarity economy.
