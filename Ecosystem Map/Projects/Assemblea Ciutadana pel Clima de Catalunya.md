The **Assemblea Ciutadana pel Clima de Catalunya** is a citizen assembly organized by the **[[Generalitat de Catalunya]]** focusing on collaborative solutions to climate change. It involves 100 citizens, selected by lottery, to deliberate and propose responses to climate challenges. This process emphasizes participatory democracy, aiming to integrate public input into policy-making.

**[[Decidim]]**, a participatory democracy platform, was used for the initiative, facilitating broader citizen engagement and transparent decision-making processes.
