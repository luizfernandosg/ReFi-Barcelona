**ReFi DAO** stands at the forefront of the [[Development/ReFi ecosystem|ReFi]] movement, aiming to create a diverse and decentralized network of local ReFi and regenerative communities. By supporting these communities with tools, research, workshops, and resources, ReFi DAO is laying the groundwork for a global regenerative economy that is both autonomous and interconnected.

Central to this mission are the 'ReFi Local Nodes', such as **[[ReFi Barcelona]]**, - dynamic, community-driven hubs that play a critical role in supporting tangible impact on the ground. Tailored to local needs and opportunities, they connect stakeholders with tools, technology and finance, and innovate on ReFi practices and solutions. Each successful Local Node marks a stride towards ReFi DAOâ€™s overarching mission of regeneration for all.
