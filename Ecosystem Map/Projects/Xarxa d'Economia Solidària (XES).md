The **Xarxa d'Economia Solidària (XES)** is a pivotal organization within Barcelona and the broader Catalan region, committed to promoting and developing the [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]]. It encompasses over 1,400 entities that are part of its social economy ecosystem. XES is dedicated to advancing an economic system that respects people, the environment, and territories, operating under principles of democracy, horizontality, transparency, equity, and participation.

Central to XES's mission is the promotion of ecosocial transition, a holistic approach that integrates ecological sustainability into the fabric of social and economic practices. XES's focus extends to regenerative agriculture and permaculture as tools for transforming agricultural challenges into opportunities for sustainability and resilience.
