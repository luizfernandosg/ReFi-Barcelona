**Plastiks** is an innovative ReFi project, based in Barcelona, that has taken a revolutionary step towards ending plastic pollution globally by leveraging the blockchain to verify the recovery and recycling of plastic waste. 

Through their platform, Plastiks offers businesses the opportunity to contribute to plastic waste recovery by purchasing digital plastic credit tokens. These credits are a testament to the recovery and recycling of plastic. This ensures that every transaction and the movement of funds from the purchase of plastic credits to the delivery to recovery entities are fully transparent and traceable.

The company operates on several fronts to enable and incentivize plastic recovery. They offer a unique proposition where businesses can incorporate plastic credits into their operations, whether through ticketing, eCommerce, customized campaigns, or digital collectibles. Notably, Plastiks has collaborated with high-profile partners such as FC Barcelona.

Central to Plastiks' ecosystem is the PLASTIK token, that facilitates the entire process of plastic recovery, from funding recovery projects to rewarding entities and individuals involved in the process. It operates on the **[[Celo]]** blockchain, known for being environmentally friendly and carbon-negative, further underscoring Plastiksâ€™ commitment to sustainability. The PLASTIK token provides a tangible way to support plastic recovery efforts, offering both financial gains and the satisfaction of contributing to a cleaner planet.
