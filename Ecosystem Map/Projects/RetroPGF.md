**RetroPGF** (Retroactive Public Goods Funding), facilitated by the Optimism Collective, is a funding mechanism to projects that contribute positively to public goods. The initiative underscores a commitment to fostering ecological and social positive actions, in line with the ReFi movement's ethos of utilizing blockchain technology for societal benefit.

RetroPGF operates through rounds of funding, where OP tokens are allocated to projects that have demonstrated significant impact in supporting the development and adoption of the **[[Optimism]]** ecosystem. These projects span various categories, including improvements to the OP Stack, governance participation enhancement, developer ecosystem support, and initiatives that boost end-user experience and adoption. 

The third round of RetroPGF, for instance, allocated 30 million OP tokens towards such contributions, underscoring the Optimism Collective's vision of rewarding community members for their positive impacts on the collective. This mechanism aims to scale the principle of "impact equals profit" globally, creating a regenerative economy where contributing to public goods is both recognized and rewarded.

The process of RetroPGF involves project applications, community voting, and the disbursement of tokens to successful projects. This community-driven approach democratizes the funding process and also ensures that contributions of real value are recognized and supported. RetroPGF rounds serve as a platform for reflecting on and iterating funding mechanisms, with the goal of continuously improving the support for public goods.
