The **Economia Social** (Social Economy) in Barcelona, particularly within the context of the ecosocial transition, embodies a transformative approach that emphasizes social, democratic, and inclusive economic models. This initiative is propelled by the Departament d’Empresa i Treball de la [[Generalitat de Catalunya]], aiming to position social and cooperative economy as a pivotal element for constructing a more socially oriented, democratic, and inclusive economic model.

Central to this initiative is the promotion of democratic businesses that generate stable, quality employment and organizations that grow sustainably and internationalize, fostering an economy deeply rooted in the community, cohesive, and entrepreneurial with core values. The program supports the [[Xarxa d’Ateneus Cooperatius]] and Singular Projects, focusing on creating socio-economic relationships that are collective, democratic, just, and solidary, thereby strengthening economic activity and creating quality jobs in their reference territories.

The **Xarxa d'Ateneus Cooperatius** covers various territories across Catalonia, aiming to strengthen the cooperative movement and the social and solidarity economy (ESS) throughout the region. It serves as a support structure that aims to build socio-economic relationships based on the principles of cooperativism and collective self-management. 

The [[Economia Social]] has also recognized research and initiatives that provide solutions for the ecosocial transition and counter rural depopulation. For instance, the 2022 Economia Social Awards, organized within this framework, honored projects that addressed these challenges through social and solidarity economy perspectives. One notable project, [[Cucsperativa]], focused on communal organic waste management using vermicomposting, highlighting an alternative to chemical fertilizers and including education on the agri-food chain. Other awarded research explored alternative models of housing tenure and use in rural areas, organizational forms based on self-management in the social third sector, and energy communities, showcasing the breadth of innovation within the Economia Social framework towards sustainable and inclusive economic models.

The underlying values of the Economia Social are crucial, prioritizing people and their needs over economic benefits. It promotes cooperation, participation, and transparency to ensure socio-economic development that is committed to the community. These values include commitment to local roots, equal opportunities, social cohesion, stable and quality job creation, and sustainability. Through supporting the formation of new cooperatives and social economy organizations, the Economia Social program endeavors to eliminate inequalities, placing people at the center of decision-making.
