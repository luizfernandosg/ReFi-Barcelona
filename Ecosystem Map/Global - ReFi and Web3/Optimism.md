# Optimism

**Optimism** is a Layer 2 scaling solution for [[Ethereum]] that aims to enhance the blockchain's efficiency by offering low-cost, fast, and scalable transactions. It operates on top of the Ethereum mainnet, leveraging optimistic rollup technology to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, thereby addressing Ethereum's scalability issues without compromising on security or decentralization.

The platform is also focused on fostering initiatives like [[RetroPGF]] (Retroactive Public Goods Funding). This innovative funding mechanism aims to reward projects that contribute to the public good. By incentivizing the development of public goods and services, Optimism seeks to create a more inclusive and equitable digital economy, where value is returned to the contributors and maintainers of the ecosystem.

Optimism's ecosystem includes a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and NFT marketplaces to tools for DAOs and bridges for asset transfer, demonstrating the network's versatility and commitment to supporting a diverse set of projects and initiatives that align with ReFi's goals. These applications contribute to a more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain experience, encouraging broader adoption and more innovative solutions to pressing global challenges.
