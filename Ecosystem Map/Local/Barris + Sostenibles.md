# Barris + Sostenibles

The **Barris + Sostenibles** (More Sustainable Neighborhoods) program integrates strategic city visions into local territories to ensure coherence between policies, municipal action in districts and neighborhoods, and citizen engagement. 

Through territorial references and proximity interventions, it empowers residents and provides tools for involvement in projects aimed at neighborhood and city improvement. Public facilities play a significant role in this initiative, offering activities, workshops, and talks to foster participation and empower citizens towards creating more sustainable neighborhoods and, by extension, a more livable city.
