# Mas la Sala

**Mas la Sala** is a community land use cooperative based in Sant Pau de Segúries, Ripollès, dedicated to the regeneration of ecosystems, resilience, and cooperation. Established in May 2020 after three years of preparatory work, the cooperative embodies the principles of regeneration through its focus on sustainable agriculture, livestock, forest management, environmental education, rural tourism, restoration, intercooperation, fine arts, and culture.

Mas la Sala operates under a non-profit model, aiming to contribute to the systemic abundance of its environment by transitioning from conventional to regenerative agricultural systems. This transition includes managing a food garden, livestock operations (with sheep, cows, pigs, bees, and poultry), and the farm’s natural woodland, all following natural cycles and rhythms to enrich the agroecological transition of their environment.

The cooperative offers accommodation for 6-8 people, promoting a cozy and functional environment ideal for families, groups, and project teams seeking to immerse themselves in a unique rural setting. They emphasize the use of organic, locally sourced produce in their restaurant services, offering simple meals prepared with traditional culinary practices.

Located in proximity to Barcelona, Mas la Sala not only contributes to the regeneration of local ecosystems and promotes sustainable living practices but also serves as a model for integrating regenerative principles into rural development and community projects.
