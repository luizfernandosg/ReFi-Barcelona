# La Comunal

**La Comunal** is a cooperative cultural space located in the Sants neighborhood of Barcelona, emerging from a collaboration among various projects within the social and solidarity economy. Its creation signifies a collective endeavor to amalgamate strengths and resources, strengthen inter-cooperative connections, and amplify the reach and community impact of its members' transformative socioeconomic activities. The cooperative is composed of seven worker cooperatives and one association, including [[Aula d’Idiomes]], [[La Directa]], [[Jamgo]], [[Irídia]], [[Lacol]], [[La Ciutat Invisible]], [[La Deskomunal]], and [[Quesoni]], aiming to establish a benchmark cultural and cooperative hub in the city.

La Comunal hosts a variety of cultural, educational, and recreational activities organized by its member organizations. These activities range from book presentations, talks, concerts, training sessions, to public assemblies, fostering a welcoming cooperative environment. By offering these events, La Comunal seeks to engage with the local community and promote non-hierarchical cooperative culture.
