# Opcions

**Opcions** is a non-profit cooperative based in Barcelona that focuses on facilitating conscious consumption. Their mission is to make it easier for individuals and organizations to consume in a manner that aligns with their values, particularly emphasizing sustainability, social justice, and personal well-being. They provide information and resources to help people consume less and better, and offer economic advantages to make conscious consumption more accessible.

Opcions operates on a membership basis, including various types of members such as service members (cooperatives offering services and/or products with advantages for consumer members), collaborating members (cooperatives that don't offer services/products to consumer members but collaborate in the project's functioning), consumer members (individuals joined in different modalities like Base, Impulse, or Support), and work members (team members with voice and vote in the governance organs). The cooperative is governed by an Assembly, which is the supreme expression of social will, and a Governing Council responsible for administration and representation.

The cooperative is actively involved in inter-cooperation with various organizations and initiatives such as [[Xarxa d'Economia Solid√†ria (XES)]], [[Pam a Pam]], [[Grup Cooperatiu Ecos]], and the [[Barcelona+Sostenible]] strategy, showcasing their deep integration and commitment to the local Barcelona community and beyond in advancing regenerative and sustainable practices.
