# Bloc4BCN

**Bloc4BCN** stands as a pioneering public-cooperative project in Barcelona. Funded by the [[Ajuntament de Barcelona]] and the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]], Bloc4BCN is part of Barcelona's 2030 [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]] Strategy. The project occupies a rehabilitated space within the Can Batlló industrial area, offering 4,500 square meters dedicated to bolstering Barcelona and Catalonia's social economy. The initiative is driven by the Association Bloc 4, with participation from the Confederació de Cooperatives de Catalunya, the [[Cooperatives de Treball]], and the [[Coòpolis - Ateneu Cooperatiu de Barcelona]].

Bloc4BCN is committed to fostering the cooperative movement, providing incubation and acceleration programs for cooperatives, enhancing inter-cooperation, and establishing connections both locally and internationally, alongside partnerships with other cultural, educational, and business entities.

**Bloc4BCN's services encompass comprehensive support** for economic projects within the [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]], from creation to consolidation. It provides advisory services, training pathways, meeting and working spaces, connectivity with the cooperative ecosystem, access to funding, and digitization to nurture successful economic projects. Additionally, it engages in sensitization campaigns to bring cooperativism closer to the public, international project connections, inter-cooperation activation, research, innovation for cooperativism growth, and the promotion of employment and social-labor insertion for particularly vulnerable groups.
