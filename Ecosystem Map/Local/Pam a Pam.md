# Pam a Pam

**Pam a Pam** serves as a collaborative map of over 1,500 initiatives that share the values and practices of the [[Economia Social|Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS)]]. These initiatives span 15 different sectors, including food, health, textiles, utilities, finance, housing, and more, all aimed at promoting conscious consumption and responsible practices. The platform not only helps consumers find responsible options but also supports transformative projects, companies, and public administrations in connecting with social market providers and collaborators.

It began as a map facilitating options for responsible consumption in food, textiles, and banking within Barcelona. The project expanded the following year with the collaboration of the [[Xarxa d'Economia Solidària (XES)|Solidarity Economy Network (XES)]] to encompass all of Catalonia and all economic sectors, making it a comprehensive guide to the ESS in the region.

Central to Pam a Pam's methodology is a set of 15 criteria designed to assess initiatives on various fronts, including:

- Internal democracy;
- Personal development;
- Feminist perspective;
- Work conditions;
- Supplier policies;
- Inter-cooperation;
- Open licenses;
- Transparency;
- Financial management;
- Social cohesion;
- Social transformation;
- Territorial roots;
- Environmental sustainability;
- Waste management;
- Energy consumption.

These criteria are organized into four blocks: 

- Basic Information;
- Social Impact;
- Environmental Impact;
- Organization and Work.

Initiatives must meet more than half of these criteria to be featured on the map, demonstrating their commitment to the principles of the ESS.

The process for including initiatives on the map is rigorous, involving on-site visits by volunteers, known as "Orange Xinxetas," who interview initiative members to assess their adherence to the Pam a Pam criteria. The assessment results are then published on the map, providing users with detailed information on each initiative's commitment to the ESS values.

The project's connection to Barcelona, where it originated, underscores its role in the city's broader movement towards sustainability and social equity. By providing a platform that connects consumers with ethical and sustainable initiatives, Pam a Pam fosters a community-driven approach to economic activity, reflecting Barcelona's growing commitment to regenerative and solidarity-based economic models.
