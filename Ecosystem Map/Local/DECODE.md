# DECODE

**DECODE** (Decentralised Citizen Owned Data Ecosystem) is a European project that leverages decentralized technologies like blockchain to enhance data sovereignty and privacy. It empowers individuals to control their dataâ€”deciding what to share, keep private, or anonymize. 

Barcelona, recognizing data as public infrastructure, aims through DECODE to foster innovation, improve public services, and empower citizens. This initiative reimagines democratic data governance, making Barcelona a model for digital rights and citizen participation in the digital age. For further details, you can explore more on [Barcelona Digital City's DECODE page](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/en/technology-accessible-everyone/accessible-and-participatory/decode).
