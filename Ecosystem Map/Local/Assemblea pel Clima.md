# Assemblea pel Clima

The **Assemblea Ciutadana pel Clima** (Citizens' Climate Assembly) in Barcelona represents a pioneering initiative by the city council to integrate citizen demands into the actions necessary to address the climate emergency. This assembly is a deliberative democratic process involving 100 randomly selected citizens, ranging from 16 to 75 years old, who deliberate on the city's climate emergency situation and propose actions and solutions to improve it. The process is structured around several key themes chosen by the participants: Energy, Mobility and Infrastructure, and Consumption and Waste, aiming to concrete municipal policies necessary to tackle the climate crisis in Barcelona.

The assembly's deliberations have led to informed recommendations for the **[[Ajuntament de Barcelona|Barcelona City Council]]**, focusing on accelerating measures to combat the climate emergency. In the energy sector, proposals are geared towards advancing the city's energy transition by reducing consumption and promoting renewable energies, energy communities, and building energy efficiency. For mobility, the recommendations aim to transform the city to prioritize sustainable transport methods, such as public transport, cycling, and walking. Lastly, in terms of consumption and waste management, there's a broad consensus on increasing recycling measures and promoting a sustainable consumption model based on local products and reducing food waste.

The Citizens' Climate Assembly is a significant step forward in participatory democracy and reflects Barcelona's commitment to addressing the climate crisis through community engagement and innovative governance models. It leverages **[[Archive/00 Buffer - check later/Decidim]]**, an open, free software platform for participatory democracy in Barcelona, to facilitate digital participation and information dissemination about the assembly process, ensuring a wide-reaching and inclusive approach to civic engagement.

The **Assemblea pel Clima** thus stands as a model of how cities like Barcelona are integrating direct citizen participation in climate action planning.
