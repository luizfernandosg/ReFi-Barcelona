# Goteo

**Goteo** is a platform for civic crowdfunding and collaboration on a variety of projects, including those focused on citizen initiatives, social, cultural, technological, and educational endeavors. Founded with a mission to foster a more ethical, collaborative internet, Goteo stands out for its commitment to generating resources for a community of communities, boasting over 65,000 people and a funding success rate of over 70%. The platform is backed by a non-profit foundation, which offers tax advantages for donors, emphasizing its dedication to principles of transparency, progress, and societal improvement.

The platform encourages projects that align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as No Poverty, Zero Hunger, and Quality Education, among others. Goteo has successfully raised significant funds to support various entities in their transformation into cooperatives and has conducted over 60 workshops to strengthen cooperation between social commitment initiatives.

Goteo operates through a [[Web3 Funding Mechanisms|matchfunding model]], where funds from institutions, organizations, or companies are used to multiply donations and increase the impact of crowdfunding projects. This model has supported a wide range of projects across different domains, including social economy, gender equality, and innovation, demonstrating a high success rate in project funding. The platform operates with a distinct two-round crowdfunding system to ensure projects not only achieve their minimum funding goals but also have the opportunity for further development and improvement.

The open-source nature of Goteo's platform is a testament to its commitment to transparency and collaborative growth. By facilitating distributed collaboration, Goteo enables contributions beyond monetary, including services, infrastructures, and microtasks, thereby enriching projects with diverse resources and expertise. This approach, coupled with the provision of collective returns on investments, aligns closely with the goals of fostering a more sustainable, equitable, and regenerative economic system.
