# Resilience Earth

**Resilience.Earth** is a non-profit cooperative deeply invested in enhancing community resilience and regenerative design as pivotal instruments for socio-ecological transformation. Their work spans across advising municipalities, facilitating participatory evaluations, strategic planning, and offering formations and spaces for debate to foster community resilience. Their commitment to innovation and constant research underlines their efforts to address contemporary challenges creatively and constructively.

Through their resource section, Resilience.Earth shares a plethora of research documents, analytical methods, and training tools produced by their innovation and research projects, indicating a rich repository of knowledge and insights available for public consumption.

One notable initiative is their Community Catalysts training program, designed to empower youth and those working with youth in climate justice, regenerative economy, and community resilience. This three-month participatory virtual training encourages the exploration of theories, strategies, and tools to design localized strategies and projects, reflecting their commitment to fostering leadership and capacity within local and global movements.

Aligned with the principles of [[ReFi]], Resilience.Earth's emphasis on community resilience, regenerative design, and their innovative approach to socio-ecological challenges suggest a natural synergy.
