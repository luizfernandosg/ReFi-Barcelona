# Fets - Finançament Ètic i Solidari

**Fets - Finançament Ètic i Solidari** - is a Catalan organization that promotes ethical and solidarity finance to transform the economic model towards a more equitable, sustainable, and solidarity-based society. It focuses on strengthening the ethical finance sector in Barcelona and beyond, offering an alternative to traditional banking systems that often prioritize profit over people and the planet.

Fets' objectives align closely with the principles of Regenerative Finance (ReFi), as both aim to leverage financial tools to foster positive ecological and social outcomes. Fets emphasizes the importance of ethical banking, microfinance, and alternative financial instruments that support local economies, social initiatives, and environmental sustainability.
