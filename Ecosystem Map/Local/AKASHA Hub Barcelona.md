# AKASHA Hub Barcelona

As a self-managed, decentralized project, **AKASHA Hub Barcelona** serves as a dynamic community and space that interconnects individuals across diverse professional backgrounds. The hub aims to generate sustainable ideas, find innovation opportunities, and develop new societal models on a GLOCAL (global + local) level.

Since its inception in 2017, Akasha Hub has been creating and supporting projects and activities that address local social innovation, sustainability, blockchain, education, governance, technological activism, design, and environmental concerns. The hub's approach to decentralized and self-managed community functioning is structured around sociocratic principles. This structure allows members to actively participate in the management and decision-making processes, further fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment.

The physical space of Akasha Hub, sprawling over 830 square meters in the Clot neighborhood, is designed to facilitate creation, co-working, design, manufacturing, and the exchange of ideas. It supports a variety of events, including workshops, conferences, and activities aligned with educational, social, and sustainable values. .
