# Decidim

**Decidim** is an open-source digital platform for participatory democracy, initially launched by the [[Ajuntament de Barcelona]]. It is designed to enable organizations like city councils, NGOs, and cooperatives to engage in participatory budgeting, public consultations, and other democratic processes online. 

By embodying principles such as transparency, integrity, and continuous improvement, Decidim aims to bridge the gap between traditional and digital democratic engagements. Its global adoption underscores its versatility in facilitating democratic participation across various contexts.

The platform's effectiveness is highlighted by its role in co-producing Barcelona's strategic city plan, incorporating nearly 7,000 citizen proposals. Beyond its local success in Barcelona, Decidim's application extends internationally, supporting democratic processes and ecosocial transitions in Europe, Latin America, in places such as:

- Barcelona, Spain through [Decidim Barcelona](https://www.decidim.barcelona/)
- New York City, USA via [Participate NYC](https://www.participate.nyc.gov/)
