# Foodcoop BCN

**FoodCoop BCN** is Barcelona's first cooperative and participatory supermarket, focusing on offering healthy, sustainable, and fair products accessible to everyone. This initiative is inspired by successful cooperative supermarket models in other cities, such as La Louve in Paris, Bees Coop in Belgium, and La Cagette in Montpellier. FoodCoop BCN aims to provide the community with quality, just, and sustainable food options, facilitating a shift towards responsible consumption and production patterns within Barcelona.

The cooperative operates on a model that encourages active participation from its members, who contribute to the running of the supermarket. This model not only fosters a sense of community and ownership among the members but also ensures that the supermarket adheres to principles of sustainability and social equity. By prioritizing products that are organic, locally sourced, and ethically produced, FoodCoop BCN directly contributes to reducing the environmental impact of food consumption and supporting local economies.

The alignment with ReFi principles is evident in FoodCoop BCN's commitment to creating a sustainable, equitable food system that empowers its members and the wider community.
