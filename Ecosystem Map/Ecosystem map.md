We see information as the foundation for building any of the bridges we want to build. Being so, that's the layer we're tackling first - here and now -; in this very medium, the [[ReFi BCN Knowledge Base]].

We're compiling here an [[Ecosystem map]] highlighting the fields we want to explore with ReFi BCN. With this initiative, we want to bring to light both the local thriving value-aligned movements of Barcelona, such as the [[Economia Social|social economy]], and global communities and tech-enablers, such as ReFi and Web3.

## Understanding what it means to be ReFi-aligned

---

Before diving into our local and global landscapes, let's address a crucial question: What exactly are ReFi-aligned projects? The answer is not straightforward as these projects are diverse and subjective in nature. However, they share common threads of aligning with the principles of Regenerative Finance (ReFi). Here, we present a selection of initiatives we've encountered in Barcelona that have inspired us with their approach to sustainability, community empowerment, and innovation.
