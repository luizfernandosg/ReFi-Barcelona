## Event description

Amidst the escalating challenges of ecological collapse and diminishing public goods funding, the need to actualize a regenerative future has never been more pressing. Timed around Earth Day, **ReFi Unconference Barcelona** serves as a symbolic rallying point, harnessing **collective community energy to build a path to safeguard our planet.**

ReFi Unconference Barcelona, organized **in collaboration with the [ReFi Barcelona](https://twitter.com/ReFiBCN)** and **[Trusted Seed](https://trustedseed.org/)**, acts as a vital bridge between prominent local eco movements—such as degrowth and cooperative initiatives—and decentralized technologies, essential for fostering an eco-social transition. We place particular emphasis on community-led initiatives like the development of l ocal nodes, recognizing their instrumental role in bridging local needs with a global network of change-makers. As part of this effort, we encourage you to join [ReFi Local Node Beta Incubator](https://lu.ma/Beta-Cohort-Incubator-1?ref=blog.refidao.com).

With a focus on urgent local issues, like the devastating water crisis in Spain, and broader global challenges, such as the imperative for coordinated action on climate change, ReFi Unconference Barcelona addresses the **pivotal role of regenerative finance and decentralized technology in resolving these crises**. Exploring Web3 affordances for dMRV and pioneering public goods funding methodologies, the event strives to chart a course towards a more regenerative future.

At its core, the ReFi Unconference Barcelona is designed to foster deep, high-quality conversations on the current state and future trajectory of the regenerative finance movement. By tackling emerging opportunities and tensions head-on, the event provides a co-creative space for participants to connect and explore avenues for realizing a community-led regenerative economy.

# Event format

The event will be structured with a mix of **traditional conference components** (talks, panels, workshops) **and a hackathon** **combined with unconference elements and community co-created spaces**.

*Stay tuned for more details regarding the final program.*
