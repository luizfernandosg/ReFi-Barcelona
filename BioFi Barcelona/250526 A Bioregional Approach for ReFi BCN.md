# A Bioregional Approach for ReFi BCN

## A. Why a Bioregional Approach for ReFi BCN?

### Groupings / Assenblages 




### Looking downwards - growing roots in the territory

- create articulations with the territory (and the territory with us)
- look for work that has already and is being done in the territory
- research/share knowledge
- provide substrate for collaboration and flow/sharing of resources
- coop structure - ReFi BCN
- what can ReFi BCN provide to projects working in the territory?
    - cooperative structure
    - access to funding, knowledge, resources, services, enablers, actors, networks


- quite early on in the development/ideation of ReFi BCN, we've come up with the contradiction of trying to achieve significant ecological impact working with an enclosure at a municipal/urban level - ReFi **Barcelona**
    - we would like not to be bound to the name - to only the city of BCN
    - we would like to stretch our arms for collaboration in the wider Catalan territory
    - because we recognize, again, that if we want to achive significant impact we cannot rely on our efforts/capacity alove, and we need to build connections and start collaborations/partnerships that allow for impactuful projects to be done
    - also, by adopting a [[Glossary#Bioregion|bioregional]] focus, we aknowledge our incapacity to do things in our own

- partnerships/collaborations

- for that we want to look into what was already produced - considering the extremely rich research field of topics related to the ecosocial [[Glossary#Bioregionalism|bioregionalism]] - such as the ecosocial transition and de/postgrowth (even noting that there's a Barcelons school of Degrowth)

            - Dark Matter Labs
                - BioFi project
            - Degrowth institute

- on the other hand (on the contradiction)
    - while the urban context does limit potential ecological impact, it is a rich space of exploration in the social aspect as spaces for...
        - mentions to
            - Ethereal forest article
            - cultura viva
                - specificities of BCN

- in ReFi BCN, by relying on the cooperative structure for us to stretch our roots into the territory
    a. we can leverage the direct connection to projects with the most potential/impact for [[Glossary#Regeneration|Regeneration]] - through networks such as the Xarxa d'Economia Solidària, that includes projects such as...
    b. to integrate these projects themselves into the coop structure, so that they are part of it(s governance)
        - establishing alliances with other projects by - for instance - one having a stake in the other
            - leveraging both the cooperative and DAO structures
            - mention to D2D collaboration
            - here draw the parallel that we want to do DAO-to-DAO collabs both with DAOs and established coops - being a bridge between them
            - leveraging our [[hybrid structure]]
            - mention articles drawing parallels between DAOs and coops

- node / network
    - the aim of ReFi BCN is to be both a node and a network

### Looking upwards - collaborating in wider bioregions/networks/ecosystems

- collaborating with other nodes
- showcasing case studies and relevant work that is being done in the territory

#### Collaborating in the wider Mediterranean

- while our main focus is our specific locality - in this case the wider territory of Catalonia
    - also looking beyond it can allow us to get additional support and collaborate on common initiatives
    - in the case of ReFi BCN
        - it is clear that a lot of work that we would be doing in ReFi BCN may be quite analogue/similar to what other ReFi local nodes are doing in localities with similar contexts, such as Rifai Sicilia, ReFi Lisboa and ReFi Paca
            - all in the enclosure of the mediterranean [[Glossary#Bioregion|Bioregion]] - specifically of its European part, with only one part outside of Europe in ReFi Mediterranean, Earthist (in Türkiye)

- and that's exactly what we're doing with ReFi Mediterranean
    - collaborating on fundraising and capital allocation for nodes part of the [[Glossary#Bioregion|Bioregion]]
    - [[ReFi Mediterranean GG23 round]]
    - platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing

## C. Funding

- ReFi BCN comes to be as a bridge of resources (and anything else?)
- but we see that the gap is too wide - and therefore we need additional articulation
- as a concrete example, we can see the fundraising and allocation of grants
- if we could only rely on global actors without any additional articulation, we'd face the point that resources can get spread quite thin, if there's
- on the other hand, if we manage to create **groupings** of nodes (improve), we can look for additional funders and partners in different levels
- stacking them for the total amount to be more significant

- a practical example of a coordination network, and infratructure that allows the allocaltion and flow of resources is the past [[ReFi Mediterranean GG23 round]]
    - in which the bioregional grouping collaborated on raising funds and running the ImpactQF round, also implementing the mechanism piloted by the Regen Coordination Global round
    - in this round participated:
        - established nodes in the [[Glossary#Bioregion|Bioregion]]
        - local [[Glossary#Regenerator|regenerative]] projects invited and supported by ReFi Med nodes (up to 2 each)
    - that's already an example of ReFi BCN and other nodes could directly provide financial and other support to projects doing local [[Glossary#Regenerator|regenerative]] work

- by coordinating with the network it makes it easier to raise funds and run rounds
- in this round already - by implementing ImpactQF - projects were rewarded/compensated with matching according to the reports of projects' work/activities they provided
    - 50% ImpactQF + 50% COCM QF
- it is an example of other rounds we would like to run in the future
    - in a more similar closed-period rounds
        - in which there could be the cadence of running 2 rounds per year, for instance
        - these rounds would initially be organized by ReFi Mediterranean, but open to projects engaging with ReFi BCN (and other nodes, of course) (funding rounds)
        - in the future ReFi BCN could run its own rounds focusing on projects in Catalunya
            - with the [[cooperative structure]] of ReFi BCN, coop member projects would be able to participate in funding rounds
            - and one of our efforts/researches is on how we can facilitate the offramping of crypto, and distribution in the way that fits projects better
                - and ReFi BCN could act as mediator to offramp funds legally/fiscally compliantly

- we could also explore other mechanisms to fund initiatives matching/making our intended impact achievable, such as
    - on-going pool of funds to fund initiatives
    - ReFi BCN is to adopt some governance mechanism
