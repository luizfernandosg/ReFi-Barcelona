# Balkar Earth

A space to investigate, reflect and learn in community.

A learning community born in 2022 and coordinated by [[Resilience Earth]].

Collective intelligence
We reflect in community to reach more creative and complex conclusions about how to hack social and systemic processes.

Disruptive proposals
We respond to challenges with social technology and change management methodologies, and with ancestral methodologies sustained by global indigenous communities.

Territorial rooting
With a trans-rural perspective, we work on proposals that make the centralist and extractive model obsolete, until we can change the territorial balances, generating new hopes.
