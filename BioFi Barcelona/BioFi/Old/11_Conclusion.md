                     “When a complex system is far from equilibrium, small
                     islands of coherence in a sea of chaos have the capacity
                     to shift the entire system to a higher order.”
                     – Ilya Prigogine

With this book, we aim to catalyze nothing less than Bioregional Financing Facilities sprouting up in every bioregion on Earth. They can take in capital from an extractive and destructive economic system and compost it to grow new, regenerative, bioregional economies that eventually do not require external capital at all, but can autonomously engage in economic reciprocity and solidarity with neighbors both near or far. In this way, Bioregional Financing Facilities can channel lifegiving nutrients and energy to, and potentially between, the islands of coherence                                           Islands of Coherence – Ilya emerging amidst increasing disequilibrium. They can support us in reanimating the                                           Prigogine, a renowned

                                                                                                                            systems, particularly localized long thinking about what is possible within the bounds of economic and financial                                            regions within a complex systems that have us locked into a path of mutually assured destruction.

Our financial architecture must serve this recognition.                                                          randomness. These islands of

Ecosystems regenerate through phases                                               organization that arises due of resource exploitation, conservation, release, and reorganization and our socio-                                          to nonlinear interactions and economic systems can do the same.258 Just as clouds gather and disperse, so too                                             feedback processes within the

257 More on the analysis behind why human survival requires imagination in Iain McGilchrist’s books: The Master and the
    Emissary and The Matter With Things. 258 “During the slow sequence from exploitation to conservation, connectedness and stability increase and a capital of
    nutrients and biomass (in ecosystems) is slowly accumulated and sequestered. Competitive processes lead to a few
    species becoming dominant, with diversity retained in residual pockets preserved in a patchy landscape. While the
    accumulated capital is sequestered for the growing, maturing ecosystem, it also represents a gradual increase in
    the potential for other kinds of ecosystems and futures. For an economic or social system, the accumulating potential
    could as well be from the skills, networks of human relationships, and mutual trust that are incrementally developed
    and tested during the progression from exploitation to conservation. Those also represent a potential developed and
    used in one setting, that could be available in transformed ones.” (Resilience Alliance: Adaptive Cycle) 259 Inspired by the Emerald podcast episode On Clouds and Cosmic Law.
