## Important Quotes
- "This book makes an argument for the decentralization of financial resource governance, and the organization of project portfolios for systemic change, to enable financial capital to reach the people and initiatives best positioned to contribute to global regeneration."
- "We recognize that the current financial system was designed to serve colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism. Over centuries, these forces have produced a massive concentration of financial resources tied to the extractive activities destroying the possibility for life on Earth to continue to thrive."
- "An effective and proportionate response to the ecological crisis requires urgent, large-scale regeneration of the biosphere rooted in ecological integrity, cultural revitalization, the centering of Indigenous wisdom, and the recognition of the interdependence of everything on Earth."

## Main Arguments
- Current financial systems perpetuate extractive processes that damage the planet
- Effective ecological crisis response requires bioregional regeneration and transition to regenerative economy
