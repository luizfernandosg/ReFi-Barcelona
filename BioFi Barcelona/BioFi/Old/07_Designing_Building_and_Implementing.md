# Designing, Building, and Implementing

move from research and template design to designing, building, and implementing BFFs through partnerships with Bioregional Organizing Teams and by catalyzing broader action in Bioregional Finance. We invite stakeholders from around the world, working across disciplines and sectors, to engage with us and with each other to support the decentralization of financial resource governance, the design of project portfolios for systemic change, and the transition to regenerative economies. We recognize that while there is no single solution to the polycrisis, Bioregional Finance can catalyze a global place-based movement that shifts value structures, and enables each of us to contribute to healing the Earth and culture in our unique ways. In Table 12 below we lay out some potential actions for key categories of actors.247 While no two bioregions will follow the same path, we hope that through shared learning and prototyping we can rapidly advance the field of Bioregional Finance in an emergent, evolutionary way. While many of these actions may on the surface look like to-do list items to check off, we suggest that they are all – including the most technocratic and technical – recommendations to form and nurture relationships of care, trust, healing, reciprocity, clear communication, and mutual learning. We look forward to embarking on this journey with all of you. The forthcoming BioFi Community of Practice on Hylo will be a key place for us all to engage.

247 These actions are not intended to be prescriptive and are not linear. We understand bioregional regeneration to be
    a complex, dynamic flow of actions and relations across multiple nested scales within a landscape and hope for
    these actions to support that process. We encourage you to consider that by reading this book, you are already an
    active participant in this movement, whether or not you identify with one of these categories. We encourage you to be
    curious about actions and relationships not listed that may be right for you to engage in.

248 See 3.1 Bioregional organizing and value creation for a list of key actors. Exercise sensitivity to the place-specific
    context impacting Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) within a place 249 Some communities and First Nations may have cultural liaison officers available to advise on engagement protocols,
    culture, and history. 250 As the first peoples of the land, their stories, including place names and language, are invaluable to the bioregional
    mapping process. 251 Bioregional Weaving Labs (Europe), Design School for Regenerating Earth (Global), and Regenerative Communities
    Network (Global) are three of many great places to start.
