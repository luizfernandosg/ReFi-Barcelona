 Policymakers, institutional and individual wealth holders, and the general
 public are increasingly recognizing the severity of the current ecological
 collapse and the risk of further collapse cascading across our interdependent
 economic, political, and social systems.

Large pools of capital have been committed to ‚Äònature‚Äô to respond to this crisis.
However both traditional and novel institutional financing mechanisms and
methodologies risk perpetuating the same extractive processes and power
structures driving the crisis.

 Many important regenerative projects and initiatives are led by people with
 deep relationships to place who are best positioned to both utilize this capital
 and support the design of contextually-sensitive financing practices more
 likely to produce regenerative outcomes.

However, these projects and initiatives, many of which are small scale and
informal, are often structurally excluded from capital sources or considered
illegible to capital holders.

 Communities around the globe are building networks of bioregional
 collaboration and solidarity, creating Bioregional Learning Centers
 and Bioregional Hubs that grow capacity for place-based learning and
 coordination towards regenerative economies.

template to empower these networks by connecting pools of capital to
regenerative projects and initiatives, and structuring these capital flows in
alignment with living systems principles and Indigenous wisdom.

 BFFs can enable financial capital to support the strengthening of relationships
 between community members, between stewards and the lands and waters
 they tend, and amongst all of the more-than-human life and living processes
 in those lands and waters.

 The warning signs from the Earth we are experiencing can be seen as an
 invitation to remember our interconnectedness with all life on the planet and
 begin embedding relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence,
 redistribution, reconnection, and critically, regeneration, in all that we design
 and build at this juncture ‚Äì including our financial systems.

 A note on language: In this book, we have chosen to use the terms
 ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù and ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù to describe all processes of providing financial
 resources. This builds on an understanding that all forms of financial capital
 provision (equity, debt, donations, grant-making, etc.) ideally yield returns,
 as in the traditional notion of investment yielding financial returns to the
 investor. However, in our broader usage of the term, we recognize that
 some investment (such as traditional impact investment) can be designed
 to yield financial returns for the investor in addition to multi-capital returns
 for a broader community, and that other investment (such as grants) can
 be designed to yield non-financial returns (such as social connection and
 inspiration) for the investor and a diversity of multi-capital returns for a
 broader community.

 Many diverse multi-capital frameworks and definitions ‚Äì including
 Indigenous concepts ‚Äì have been proposed in recent years to offer
 language for breaking from the perception that money is the only form of
 capital flowing around and through us. The authors celebrate this diversity
 of frameworks as an insight into the diverse nature of value itself and
 do not recommend the global use of a single homogenous multi-capital
 framework. However, this book focuses on the 4 Returns Framework1
 (financial, social, ecological, inspiration) due to its accessibility and
 demonstrable success. At times this book draws upon language from the
 seminal Eight Forms of Capital2 (intellectual, spiritual, social, material,
 financial, living, cultural, and experiential).

 Summary
-> 1. Introduction
We are living in the midst of widespread and recognized destruction of the living
world. The ecological crisis, the crisis faced by Indigenous nations, multiple
geopolitical crises, the economic crisis, the refugee and migrant crisis, the energy
crisis, the inequity crisis, and social crises are deeply interconnected and mutually
reinforcing. In face of this ‚Äúpolycrisis,‚Äù a key realization is now spreading: the
global economy cannot survive the ecological and social destabilization on the
horizon. This recognition among economic and financial policymakers, the financial
sector, and real sector corporations marks a shift away from the false, myopic, and
devastating view that the economy is separate from the biosphere. Developing
modes of being aligned with Indigenous values in rallying communities to respond in
service to life will be key in adapting humanity‚Äôs response to the polycrisis.

As awareness and understanding grow, and regulatory pressure increases,
actors from across the financial sector are beginning to direct financial capital
towards supporting biocultural regeneration. While on the surface this might seem Biocultural regeneration ‚Äì
promising, there is significant risk that if these resources flow through the existing A holistic and interconnected

In this critical moment, the authors propose a new layer in the global financial
financial resource governance, the design of project portfolios for systemic change,
and the transition to a regenerative economy. They have the potential to become the
connective tissue between financial resources and on-the-ground regenerators.
They can do this by enabling strategic, integrated capital raised from a variety of
sources to flow to aggregated portfolios of systemically coordinated and supported
regenerative projects on the ground. In return, regeneration benefits can flow
back to investors in a community-determined, non-extractive way. We believe this
infrastructure is needed to put finance in service to life and Indigenous wisdom.
