 Foreword
This book makes an argument for the decentralization of financial resource
governance, and the organization of project portfolios for systemic change, to
enable financial capital to reach the people and initiatives best positioned to
contribute to global regeneration. It makes the case for the urgent development
and piloting of a new structure to support this decentralization ‚Äì the Bioregional
Financing Facility (BFF) ‚Äì which every bioregion on Earth could create to support its
transition to a regenerative economy. We believe that BFFs can help align financial
flows with living systems principles and Indigenous wisdom, to serve the thriving of
all life on Earth ‚Äì a purpose shared by all of us who contributed to this book.
We recognize that the current financial system was designed to serve colonialism,
imperialism, and capitalism. Over centuries, these forces have produced a
massive concentration of financial resources tied to the extractive activities
destroying the possibility for life on Earth to continue to thrive. As awareness of
the polycrisis grows, a wave of capital is forming that is attempting to avert further
ecological, social, and economic collapse. And yet, there is a significant risk that if
this capital flows through a financial architecture rooted in the same life-denying
and inequitable power structures and logic based on abstraction, it will simply
perpetuate, and perhaps even accelerate, the existing extractive processes.
An effective and proportionate response to the ecological crisis requires urgent,
large-scale regeneration of the biosphere rooted in ecological integrity, cultural
revitalization, the centering of Indigenous wisdom, and the recognition of the
interdependence of everything on Earth. This will only be possible through local
actions taken by the many small groups all over the world that are living in ‚Äúright
relationship‚Äù with place ‚Äì in both rural and urban settings. These groups are active
stewards and many have Indigenous and traditional practices for land management
that can be interwoven with Western scientific insights and technology to support
critically impactful biocultural regeneration and repair.
Indeed, we believe that the recognition and empowerment of the sovereignty
of Indigenous peoples must be foundational in our response to the ecological
crisis. We must learn from these original stewards about the roles of relationality,
reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence, redistribution, reconnection, and
critically, regeneration, in all that we design and build ‚Äì including evolutions of the
global financial system.
There is currently a lack of connective tissue between those that hold and
manage the large pools of financial resources seeking regenerative impact, and
the coalitions of actors on the ground carrying out critical regeneration activities.

benefits between these two currently disconnected groups of actors to support
regeneration free of externalities, exploitation, and oppression. BFFs can serve
as semi-permeable membranes between institutions rooted in the status
quo economic paradigm and the emerging bioregional economies applying
fundamentally different economic logic and value systems. The authors and team of
advisors believe that BFFs are a critical piece of the financial architecture needed to

respond to the ecological crisis, in particular, and the polycrisis more broadly.
In these pages, we aim to raise awareness among investors and policymakers
of the urgency and importance of decentralizing financial resource governance
to achieve global climate and nature goals, and to mitigate further ecological,
economic, and social collapse. We also hope to catalyze Bioregional Organizing
Teams and Indigenous communities around the world to design and implement
these facilities, and develop project portfolios for systemic change, so that they
may raise and deploy financial capital that supports their transition to regenerative
economies. We aim to motivate a network of philanthropists, public grant providers,
and investors to capitalize these facilities through a strategic, integrated capital
approach. Additionally, we hope to inspire innovators, futurists, designers, and
artists from across disciplines and worldviews to develop new financial and
governance tools, business models, and ownership structures that can support the
realization of the value of biocultural regeneration at multiple scales.

movements for economic, ecological, and social justice and liberation; and the
inspired efforts of peoples around the world organizing autonomously for the
regeneration of the biosphere and their local-global communities. It is informed
by persistent innovation in the fields of economics, finance, ecology, evolutionary
biology, and systems theory. BFFs were born out of and can support the web of
interdependent efforts of the broader regenerative movement.

this book, at least in part, for this reason. Money confers power and choice. It holds
the potential to be both a great destroyer, and a great organizer. As a result, finance
‚Äì how money is designed and flows ‚Äì is a key leverage point for systems change
and largely determines how our systems impact our ecological basis of survival.
We believe deeply that BFFs can wield and reshape finance to empower
regeneration. And, perhaps more importantly, for all those who will be attracted to
engage with BFFs ‚Äì either as a lever for systems change or a source of funding ‚Äì
we believe this new class of financial institution can catalyze more life-affirming
worldviews and deeper place-based relationships with all life in a bioregion.
Finance is just a vehicle. Planetary regeneration is our journey.
We value your willingness as you explore this book to engage with us on the
possibilities for these new institutions in serving the flourishing of all life on Earth.

 Key Messages

 Key Messages
 Policymakers, institutional and individual wealth holders, and the general
 public are increasingly recognizing the severity of the current ecological
 collapse and the risk of further collapse cascading across our interdependent
 economic, political, and social systems.

Large pools of capital have been committed to ‚Äònature‚Äô to respond to this crisis.
However both traditional and novel institutional financing mechanisms and
methodologies risk perpetuating the same extractive processes and power
structures driving the crisis.

 Many important regenerative projects and initiatives are led by people with
 deep relationships to place who are best positioned to both utilize this capital
 and support the design of contextually-sensitive financing practices more
 likely to produce regenerative outcomes.

However, these projects and initiatives, many of which are small scale and
informal, are often structurally excluded from capital sources or considered
illegible to capital holders.

 Communities around the globe are building networks of bioregional
 collaboration and solidarity, creating Bioregional Learning Centers
 and Bioregional Hubs that grow capacity for place-based learning and
 coordination towards regenerative economies.

regenerative projects and initiatives, and structuring these capital flows in

 BFFs can enable financial capital to support the strengthening of relationships
 between community members, between stewards and the lands and waters
 they tend, and amongst all of the more-than-human life and living processes
 in those lands and waters.

 The warning signs from the Earth we are experiencing can be seen as an
 invitation to remember our interconnectedness with all life on the planet and
 begin embedding relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence,
 redistribution, reconnection, and critically, regeneration, in all that we design
 and build at this juncture ‚Äì including our financial systems.

 A note on language: In this book, we have chosen to use the terms
 ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù and ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù to describe all processes of providing financial
 resources. This builds on an understanding that all forms of financial capital
 provision (equity, debt, donations, grant-making, etc.) ideally yield returns,
 as in the traditional notion of investment yielding financial returns to the
 investor. However, in our broader usage of the term, we recognize that
 some investment (such as traditional impact investment) can be designed
 to yield financial returns for the investor in addition to multi-capital returns
 for a broader community, and that other investment (such as grants) can
 be designed to yield non-financial returns (such as social connection and
 inspiration) for the investor and a diversity of multi-capital returns for a
 broader community.

 Many diverse multi-capital frameworks and definitions ‚Äì including
 Indigenous concepts ‚Äì have been proposed in recent years to offer
 language for breaking from the perception that money is the only form of
 capital flowing around and through us. The authors celebrate this diversity
 of frameworks as an insight into the diverse nature of value itself and
 do not recommend the global use of a single homogenous multi-capital
 framework. However, this book focuses on the 4 Returns Framework1
 (financial, social, ecological, inspiration) due to its accessibility and
 demonstrable success. At times this book draws upon language from the
 seminal Eight Forms of Capital2 (intellectual, spiritual, social, material,
 financial, living, cultural, and experiential).

 Summary
-> 1. Introduction
We are living in the midst of widespread and recognized destruction of the living
world. The ecological crisis, the crisis faced by Indigenous nations, multiple
geopolitical crises, the economic crisis, the refugee and migrant crisis, the energy
crisis, the inequity crisis, and social crises are deeply interconnected and mutually
reinforcing. In face of this ‚Äúpolycrisis,‚Äù a key realization is now spreading: the
global economy cannot survive the ecological and social destabilization on the
horizon. This recognition among economic and financial policymakers, the financial
sector, and real sector corporations marks a shift away from the false, myopic, and
devastating view that the economy is separate from the biosphere. Developing
modes of being aligned with Indigenous values in rallying communities to respond in
service to life will be key in adapting humanity‚Äôs response to the polycrisis.

As awareness and understanding grow, and regulatory pressure increases,
actors from across the financial sector are beginning to direct financial capital
towards supporting biocultural regeneration. While on the surface this might seem Biocultural regeneration ‚Äì

In this critical moment, the authors propose a new layer in the global financial
financial resource governance, the design of project portfolios for systemic change,
and the transition to a regenerative economy. They have the potential to become the
connective tissue between financial resources and on-the-ground regenerators.
They can do this by enabling strategic, integrated capital raised from a variety of
sources to flow to aggregated portfolios of systemically coordinated and supported
regenerative projects on the ground. In return, regeneration benefits can flow
back to investors in a community-determined, non-extractive way. We believe this
infrastructure is needed to put finance in service to life and Indigenous wisdom.

as an evolution of impact investing. They seek to establish a financial architecture
that recognizes the complexity inherent to systemic transformation, and the
fundamental interconnectedness of interventions. They help to build synergistic
and systemic investment portfolios, creating positive spillover values which enable
mutually reinforcing and positive feedback loops of systemic value generation
across projects.

BFFs provide a pathway for even multinational corporations ‚Äì that often seem to
operate everywhere and nowhere at the same time ‚Äì to come back into relationship
with the very real places and people they are dependent on and are in turn
impacting. BFFs enable them to move towards healing and reciprocity through how
they invest.

-> 5. BFF Governance and Capital Allocation
The governance structure of BFFs underpins their ability to both decentralize
financial resource governance and catalyze the transition to a regenerative
economy. As BFFs represent an intentional attempt to encode an institution with
worldviews, values, logic, and context that are fundamentally distinct from those of

existing financial institutions, governance will be a challenging area requiring great
care and collective experimentation. The assumptions and habits of governance
learned through participation in traditional institutions may not serve BFFs, and both
intra- and interpersonal friction in the learning process will likely emerge. It is critical
for BFFs to cultivate a healthy unlearning/learning culture where they can carefully
consider and experiment with what values are encoded in their governance, who
participates, and what frameworks, processes, and tools are applied.

At the highest level, we encourage BFFs to implement an inclusive, participatory
governance structure that represents the bioregion and is built upon a solid
relational foundation of trust. BFFs governance design does not emerge from
a vacuum, but rather from the rich context of the learnings and relationships
built throughout bioregional organizing efforts and the creation of a Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy, which can clarify specific, place-based understandings of
the values that are to be upheld governance. In particular, we recommend careful
consideration of the ‚ÄúR Values‚Äù that many Indigenous communities center in their
governance (Section 4.1).11 We offer many proven and emergent frameworks,
processes, and tools that can support BFFs in both governance design and practice.

Finally, we encourage BFFs to explicitly design their governance towards three
key aims: shift power imbalances, work with existing authorities, and build right
relationship with other BFFs across regions and scales. This is hard, messy
work with no easy answers that fit all contexts. However, we trust that through
experiments in creating BFFs around the world, the collective intelligence of place
can be harnessed to inform and support an entire network of BFFs ‚Äì allowing
common patterns of trustworthy governance structures to emerge.

-> 6. Innovative Mechanisms for Financing Bioregional
Regeneration
A series of innovative financial tools and approaches is emerging that can help to
capitalize BFFs and support the transition of a bioregional economy. Some worth
mentioning include:

‚Äî Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Web3-based eco-credits
‚Äî (Digital) Nature-based Currencies
‚Äî Local Market Networks & Bioregional Vouchers
‚Äî Bioservices Banks
‚Äî Participatory grant-making through quadratic and Conviction Voting
‚Äî Quadratic Funding and Equity Crowdfunding as proxies for capital allocation
‚Äî Place-based Bioregional Tithing, voluntary taxation, and Business Improvement
 Districts
‚Äî Advance Market Commitments for bioregional regeneration
‚Äî Profit Pooling and whole-economy health as triggers for investor returns

Many of the themes explored in this book are aligned with the values and patterns
driving the decentralized finance or ‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù movement. The authors believe that the
potential of existing protocols, tools, technologies, and templates in the Web3 space
to bolster the bioregional movement and supercharge grassroots regeneration, has
‚Äì as yet ‚Äì not been realized.

11 For example: relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence, regeneration, redistribution, and
 reconnection

-> 7. Additional Case Studies: Stories of Bioregional
Organizing and Bioregional Finance in Action
In addition to the multiple case studies throughout this book, five more case
studies are presented in the annex. Each of the case studies tells diverse stories of
combining dedicated social processes and thoughtful technological innovations to
create strong foundations for BFFs. While each is substantial as a standalone case
study, they represent, as a set of interdependent stories, a collective case study in
how creative efforts across bioregions are resourcing each other and the global
movement.

-> 8. Next Steps and Call to Action
A series of recommendations and calls to action are presented for important
stakeholder groups: Bioregional Organizers; Regenerators and Indigenous
Communities, Nations, and Tribes; Investors; Philanthropists; Policymakers;
Multilaterals and Development Agencies; Innovators and Futurists; Designers;
Economists; and Financial Services Consultants. While many of these actions may
on the surface look like to-do list items to check off, we suggest that they are all ‚Äì
including the most technocratic and technical ‚Äì actually suggestions for forming
and nurturing relationships of care, trust, healing, reciprocity, clear communication,
and mutual learning.

Most of these recommended actions are not merely speculative. They have
been sourced from a diverse set of active practitioners around the world. Thus,
our list may also be seen as a celebration of the strength and maturity of existing
bioregional organizing, coordination, and financing efforts. And yet, there is still
much to do, and innovation to pursue, for this movement to cohere, and for BFFs
to be established as effective, trustworthy institutions.
The recommended actions should not be understood as prescriptive or linear. Not

all actions will look the same, or be needed across all contexts, and they do not
need to follow an ordered sequence from first to last. We understand bioregional
regeneration is a complex, dynamic flow of actions and relations across multiple
nested scales within a landscape and our global networks, and we see these
actions as supporting that process.

Finally, we encourage you to consider that by reading this book, you are already an
active ‚Äì even essential ‚Äì participant in this movement, whether or not you resonate
with everything written or identify as a key stakeholder. We encourage you to hold
your professional or place-based identities lightly, and approach this book with
curiosity towards the relationships and actions ‚Äî listed and unlisted ‚Äî that feel
most compelling to you. Perhaps look up from the screen or the page every once in

 1. Introduction

 1. Introduction
1.1 The state of the planet
We are living in the midst of widespread and recognized destruction of the living
world. The scale and causes of this destruction are widely known and well-docu-
mented: approximately 75 percent of the Earth‚Äôs ice-free land surface and 66 per-
cent of its marine environment have been significantly altered as of 201912, and at
least 20 percent of its land surface is now degraded13. The average global popula-
tions of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians declined by 68 percent from
1970 to 2016, with South America seeing a 94 percent decline14. Nearly 1 million
animal and plant species (of 8 million recorded species) are now threatened with
extinction;15 extinction rates are tens to hundreds of times higher than they aver-
aged over the past 10 million years.16

2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global
mean near-surface temperature reaching approximately 1.40 (¬± 0.12) ¬∞C above
the 1850‚Äì1900 average17. A recent study found that the Atlantic meridional over-
turning circulation (AMOC), or the Atlantic Ocean current, is showing early signs
of collapse18. The global pollution crisis has escalated to unprecedented levels, as
evidenced by the ubiquitous occurrence of microplastics. These microplastics have
been detected in clouds, aquifers, bottled water19, and even in the human placen-
ta,20 representing what has been called a ‚Äúslow-motion oil spill‚Äù through all the
waters on Earth.21 Additionally, research shows that per- and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
stances (PFAS) or resistant ‚Äúforever chemicals,‚Äù widely used in consumer products,
are constantly cycling through the ground, air, and water and can now be found in
even the most remote regions on Earth.22 14 of the 18 assessed categories of eco-
system services have deteriorated since 197023 and 6 of 9 planetary boundaries
have now been exceeded.24 Approximately 1.7 Earths would be required to maintain
the world‚Äôs current living standards with current economic systems.25 Humanity‚Äôs
demands far exceed the Earth‚Äôs ability to meet them, and this gap is widening.

 Planetary boundaries ‚Äì A scientific framework that presents a set of nine biophysical
 thresholds (shown below), ‚Äúwithin which humanity can continue to develop and thrive
 for generations to come.‚Äù Crossing boundaries increases the risk of generating large-
 scale abrupt or irreversible ecological changes.26

 Building on the planetary boundaries framework, the Doughnut Model27 (see
 Figure 2.) by Kate Raworth argues that a safe and just operating space for humanity
 is not only constrained by ecological ceilings but also a social foundation that needs
 to be sufficiently strengthened to reach sustainable prosperity. The social foundation,
 according to Raworth, comprises 12 factors: Food Security, Health, Education, Income
 and Work, Peace and Justice, Political Voice, Social Equity, Gender Equality, Housing,
 Networks, Energy, and Water. The social factors are more difficult to measure
 quantitatively on a planetary scale. Hence, the Doughnut Model is often used for
 local or place-based rather than planetary analyses.

1.2 The polycrisis and collapse
The world right now is characterized by a number of deeply interconnected and
mutually reinforcing crises, which together are driving the unfolding phenomenon
increasingly referred to as ‚Äúthe polycrisis‚Äù. Some of these are:

‚Äî the ecological crisis, encompassing climate change, biodiversity collapse, soil
 degradation, the pollution crisis, and water and food scarcity;
‚Äî the crisis faced by Indigenous nations as they continue to be subjected to harm
 and disempowerment perpetrated by settler colonialism and corporations;
‚Äî multiple geopolitical crises, including ongoing genocide, famine, wars, energy
 security, and nuclear risk;
‚Äî the economic crises of persistent poverty, extreme inequality, and ballooning
 sovereign debt
‚Äî the refugee and migrant crisis;
‚Äî the risk of exponential technological development, such as artificial
 intelligence, gene editing, synthetic biology, and novel chemical manufacturing
 creating unintended catastrophic consequences
‚Äî social crises, including the anxiety, depression, and loneliness spreading
 predominantly in high income countries; and
‚Äî health crises, including pandemics, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.

The authors believe that these are signs that Gaia is not healthy. The Gaia
hypothesis, first published by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis in 1979, postulates
that the Earth's surface is maintained in a habitable state by self-regulating
feedback mechanisms involving organisms (including humans) tightly coupled with
their environment. Through this lens, Gaia is understood as a single, global entity
that keeps the conditions on the planet within boundaries that are favorable to life.40

It is becoming clearer each day that the consequences of continuing on our
current economic trajectory are not only unsustainable economically, but include
significant existential risks. Humanity must swiftly and dramatically shift how it
feeds, clothes, shelters, and transports itself. It must change how it builds its cities
and manufactures its goods. It must repair the relationship between people and
place. For these changes to be effective, they must be rooted in a worldview
shift where we return to seeing and experiencing the Earth as a living, breathing,
interconnected organism ‚Äì of which humans evolved as an integral part ‚Äì and not
a resource to be extracted from.55 All life on Earth is connected, and so the only
two paths forward are mutually assured destruction or mutually assured thriving.56
Today, we are equipped with an unprecedented array of capabilities and tools
to support us in sensing, sensemaking, decentralized governance, coordination,
planning, and envisioning. If properly deployed, the incredible technical capacities
humanity has built can help us meet the complex challenges we are facing
collectively.

 ‚ÄúNature is a totally efficient, self-regenerating system.
 If we discover the laws that govern this system and live
 synergistically within them, sustainability will follow and
 humankind will be a success.‚Äù

 CASE STUDY 1:
 Salmon Nation: Envisioning a Nature State
 By Spencer Beebe, Christopher Brookfield, Cheryl Chen, Ian Gill, Edward West

 About Salmon Nation
 Salmon Nation is two things: a bioregion whose boundaries are defined by the
 presence of wild Pacific salmon from Central California to the North Slope of
 Alaska, from the ocean to the mountain tops; and an idea that people can organize
 themselves within a nature state: a big, diverse, powerful and holistic integration of

84 In the World Bank book, Decentralization and Biodiversity Conservation (published in 1996), the Multilateral
 Development bank lays out, in 10 country case studies and 32 projects analyses, how decentralization of governance
 (including political, fiscal, administrative, and legislative power) can positively support biodiversity conservation
 outcomes. ‚ÄúA conclusion from the historical review of country experience is that centralized, top-down conservation
 is seldom effective, except where large budgets are available for enforcement and the society concerned is willing to
 accept a rather undemocratic conservation process.‚Äù

 people and place with thriving local communities, living in deep relationship with the
 lands and waters that nourish them.
 Theory of change
 The idea of Salmon Nation is organized around the idea that there are abundant
 enterprising individuals, particularly in ‚Äúedge communities,‚Äù which are outside the
 centers of power and money, who are actively adapting to climate change and
 innovating a path towards a more enduring prosperity. The theory of change of
 Salmon Nation holds that at the ‚Äúedges‚Äù exist the seeds of a new way to live in step
 with natural systems. Edges are rural and urban, but typically remote from traditional
 sources of power. Edges are diverse and innovative, and they hold profound stocks
 of human and natural capital resources. At this intersection of built and natural
 infrastructure, edges represent vast areas of land and water that can accommodate a
 bioregional shift toward regenerative practices.
 To advance this theory of change, The Salmon Nation Trust (a public benefit LLC)
 and the Magic Canoe (a non profit organization), and more recently, Salmon Nation
 Studios, were launched to use whole system design and human networks focused
 on celebration, storytelling, reciprocity, and the replication and acceleration of what
 works to support creative individuals in ways that improve social, economic, and
 natural well-being and unleash regenerative innovation. Together they aim to find,
 connect, and support a network of entrepreneurs across the bioregion engaged
 in deep innovation across a full spectrum of initiatives: regenerative agriculture,
 ecological forestry and fishing, language preservation, tribal sovereignty, watershed
 protection and restoration, community level health delivery, housing, arts, culture,
 education, social media, social networks, small business development, and local
 governance.
 The Salmon Nation Trust‚Äôs main focus is to incubate and spawn bioregional ventures
 and is lightly governed by high-profile advisors who hold high public trust to maintain
 mission alignment, integrity and public benefit impact. They are ‚ÄúTrustees‚Äù with the
 ability to call for the Trust‚Äôs dissolution if there is material mission drift, but without
 operating control or fiduciary liability. This public-trust based governance and
 equity structure allows the bioregion as a whole to be the ultimate benefactor of this
 collaborative. Bioregional ventures the Trust has spawned include The Magic Canoe,
 a public purpose enterprise designed to celebrate and amplify stories that have the
 power to inspire tangible, at-scale change in our bioregion; as well as Salmon Nation
 Studios, which is focused on accelerating collaborative ventures that catalyze the
 development of local, place-based solutions.
 A holistic approach
 A holistic strategy is implemented under this collaborative structure, which is framed
 by three core functions:
 1. Discovery & Storytelling ‚Äì Immerse in edge communities, cultivate reciprocity and
 trust, share, amplify, inspire what works, and surface diverse entrepreneurs of
 place-based creativity and innovation.
 2. Weaving & Connecting ‚Äì Connect, share, inspire, and instigate unlikely
 collaborations and cross-pollination.
 3. Replication & Acceleration ‚Äì Apply human, social, and financial capital to support,
 scale, and replicate regenerative solutions that are already working in the edges.
 Enable edges to ‚Äòleapfrog‚Äô the centers.

2.2 Financial resources are needed to catalyze
bioregional regeneration and the transition to a
regenerative economy
Despite the immense promise and potential of bioregional-scale organizing,
strategic planning, and implementation, these initiatives and the organizations and
individuals they work to support are chronically underfunded around the world.
Resources that are mobilized still hinge on a financial architecture that is ill-suited
to catalyze regeneration efforts. As a result, progress is far too slow and limited
in scale given the pace of change required by the polycrisis. Ensuring food and
water security as well as disaster resilience, to name only a few key challenges,
will all require major investments in bioregional resilience and regeneration and
the transition to a regenerative economy. In conducting this research, we spoke to
pioneering watershed, landscape, and Bioregional Organizing Teams as well as
Indigenous community members from around the world, and all of them share the
challenge of accessing sufficient investment to support this economic transition.

Additionally, public and philanthropic grant capital often flows to multilateral or
regional development banks, multilateral agencies, or large NGOs that have
high overhead, burdensome bureaucracy, and may lack close relationships with
grassroots efforts. In the case of financial resources reaching Indigenous land and
water stewards, there is often a government entity between the organization with
the funding and the Indigenous nation or community. This creates problematic
power dynamics that prevent the resources from getting to the people on the
ground.87,88 There is a lack of connective tissue (trunk and branches in Figure 5.)

pool of financial resources (leaves of the tree) and the coalitions of actors on the

At this critical moment, the authors propose a new layer in the global financial
of financial resource governance, the design of project portfolios for systemic
change, and the transition to a regenerative economy. They have the potential to
become the connective tissue between financial resources and on-the-ground
regenerators. They can achieve this by enabling integrated capital raised from a
variety of sources to flow to aggregated portfolios of systemically coordinated and
supported regenerative projects on the ground. In return, regeneration benefits can
flow back to investors in a community-determined, non-extractive way. We believe
this infrastructure is needed to put financial systems in service to life.

87 This is the case with large multilateral funds focused on ecological regeneration including: the Global Environment
 Facility, the Green Climate Fund, and the Climate Investment Funds.

 governance: Move the distribution of financial
 decision-making authority and management
 responsibilities away from a centralized or
 top-down authority and toward local self-
 determination supported by collective intelligence
 across scales. This can be accomplished with a
 group of representatives that is more connected
 to a particular place and its ethnic or cultural
 identities and more attuned to the patterns of the
 living systems in that place. This aims to improve the efficiency, effectiveness,
 and responsiveness of resource allocation in delivering regeneration and
 resilience to avert and mitigate further ecological, social, and economic
 collapse. It also shifts the current unsustainable power imbalance inherent in
 economic inequality and the abstraction built into the current structure of the
 global financial system.

 to abstracted ‚Äòthings‚Äô whose entire value can be measured completely in
 dollars. Such an economy becomes increasingly self-reliant, staying within its
 ecological boundaries without compromising the ability of other bioregions
 and future generations to meet their needs.

 Regenerative economies will look different in every bioregion, marking a
 move away from the current monoculture economy that touches almost
 every corner of the planet, to more biodiverse economies93 that are
 driven by community needs and values, and their ecological contexts.94
 Regenerative economies enable people in a place to decide collectively
 what they value, map those assets in their bioregion, and invest holistically in
 allowing communities to effectively resource alternative visions as they
 rebuild economic sovereignty to address the polycrisis ‚Äì while avoiding
 extractive entanglements with the existing global financial architecture.

 ‚Äì Peter Berg And Raymond F. Dasmann

While every bioregion will have its own particular investment needs95 that will inform
the design of the facilities it creates, and each facility within a bioregion will have a
different structure, there are twelve high-level attributes our research tells us each
facility should work towards, and eventually meet to achieve its dual objectives.
These attributes are as follows (for further explanation see Section 4):

93 One source that served as inspiration to the authors that explores a range of economic structures beyond capitalism,
 is the book Thrive: Fundamentals for a New Economy by Kees Klomp and Shinta Oosterwaal. Some of the economic
 structures the book explores include: the Well Being Economy, System Value Economy, Eco-feminist Economy,
 Indigenous Economy, Sacred Economy, Radical Circular Economy, and others. Other sources of inspiration include:
 Indigenous Economics: Sustaining People and Their Lands by Ronald Trosper and Hoodie Economics by Jack
 Manning Bancroft.
94 In these economies financial returns should be informed by what is regenerative in the context of an ecology and
 culture, not a global benchmark.
95 These will be closely tied to the sequencing of activities, the current level of financialization of an economy, whether
 the primary activities are rural or urban, whether territory is still governed by Indigenous peoples, the level or
 investment readiness, etc.

3.2 The phases of multi-stakeholder bioregional
 regeneration
As seen in the pioneering and successful work of both Bioregional Weaving Labs
and Regenerate Cascadia, efforts can be organized in 5 phases of Preparation,
Mapping and Analysis, Convening and Activation, Co-initiation and Co-creation, and
finally Co-evolution. This is, accordingly, a process that organizing teams may want
to follow, and is outlined below (also see Table 4 for an overview).

The initial phase of Preparation allows the Bioregional Organizing Team to form,
clarify roles, and build a shared understanding of the mission ‚Äì stewarding the
regeneration of their bioregion. Often, this team of intrinsically motivated and
dedicated individuals is ‚Äúhosted‚Äù by one or more already established backbone106
organizations that allows the team to use its facilities and provides it with initial
resources. The hosting organization is usually a mission-oriented entity that already
seeks to drive change in the region in some way.

During the second phase, Mapping and Analysis, the organizing team convenes
local Indigenous peoples and residents alongside subject matter experts to share
their unique knowledge of place in order to better understand the current state
of the region and the small watersheds and landscapes within it. This phase
comprises a combination of participatory processes such as place mapping
and high-level mapping of biophysical, social, and economic systems; assets
and opportunities; and risks, needs, or challenges (see Table 3.). These become
powerful tools for analysis and decision making, and enable the development of a
shared and coherent story of place that can be built on in later phases. Particular Story of place ‚Äì A holistic

In the Mapping and Analysis phase, the organizing team will also seek to
understand potential levers for systemic change, and to establish a high-level
Theory of Change112. Key stakeholders and their relationships will be mapped,
the boundaries of the bioregion may begin to be defined (see Section 2.1), and an
overview of already established change initiatives, both incremental and systemic,
will be created. Finally, an initial mapping of potential investment sources for the
organizing team and for bioregional interventions more broadly can be a useful step
during this phase.

112 Wikipedia: Theory of Change

In the third phase, Convening and Activation, the organizing team facilitates
multiple forums and activities, deliberately including a wide range of stakeholder
groups in collective and highly participatory processes to drive deep biocultural
regeneration as outlined above. Integrating community art, ritual, ceremony, and
conviviality into this activation phase enables networks of trust to form, from which a
shared vision for the landscape is co-created for example, in the form of a manifesto
(see BWL South East Ireland case study). This joint vision serves as the foundation
for the subsequent development of a long-term Bioregional Regeneration Strategy,
such as the BIOREGIONAL PLAN 2030 of the Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance.
This ‚Äòliving blueprint‚Äô to protect 86 million acres of bio-culturally diverse tropical
rainforests was developed through a three-and-a-half year participatory process.
30 Indigenous nations in Ecuador and Peru drew on their Indigenous stewardship
visions and practices, and the principles of ‚ÄúBuen Vivir‚Äù (an Indigenous approach to
collective well-being), to identify ‚Äúsolution pathways‚Äù.113

When it is time to move into the fourth phase of Co-initiation and Co-creation,
the organizing team may want to establish or empower the establishment of one
or several stand-alone Bioregional Hubs, as outlined in Section 3.3, that can help
enhance local capacity and prepare projects for potential investments. A key
focus in this phase is placed on aligning existing initiatives with the Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy, and amplifying their impact in accordance with the
strategy. Simultaneously, the engagement of activated stakeholders may lead to
the inception of new projects and initiatives. Drawing inspiration from successful
models elsewhere, proven solutions can be adapted to suit the unique context of
the bioregion. It is in this phase that we also suggest properly setting up BFFs, as
detailed in Section 4. This includes the meticulous identification of a decentralized
governance structure that empowers citizens to become decision-makers in
financial resource allocation and the recruitment of a skilled management team.
To broaden the scope of the bioregional regeneration process and to democratize
agency, additional stakeholders are invited to engage, while efforts are made to
explore and adapt cutting-edge bioregional governance systems. A concerted
communication strategy can be implemented to share learnings and efforts with the
wider public, and channels may be established for effective communication with
neighboring bioregions, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.

Throughout all phases, it is important to understand this process as Co-evolution:
a continuous cycle of adaptive iterations. Learnings need to be integrated on
an ongoing basis and actions adapted to emergent developments114 in complex
undertakings such as bioregional regeneration through a bottom-up multi-
stakeholder approach. Mutual exchange of learnings and insights with regeneration
teams of other bioregions can inform the process and create a strong tapestry of
bioregional work around the world.

While these phases can be initiated in a linear fashion, they can also be referenced
nonlinearly through an ecosystem approach, particularly for bioregions with an
extensive history of organizing. For example, Mapping & Analysis and Co-evolution
may happen throughout all phases, supporting iterative sense-making and learning
for robust Co-initiation and Co-creation activities. See Regenerate Cascadia's case
study as an example of a large bioregion with extensive bioregional organizing
history engaging these phases nonlinearly.
113 The bioregional plan seeks to address five shared bioregional objectives: improving living conditions, advancing
 Indigenous rights and territorial governance, stopping deforestation and degradation, conserving forests and
 restoring degraded areas, and stopping the advancement of extractive industries (Amazon Sacred Headwaters).

 Bioregional Regeneration
 By Sarah Prosser & Karin M√ºller

 About Bioregional Weaving Labs
 A Bioregional Weaving Lab (BWL) is a geographically grounded, multi-stakeholder
 partnership process that connects place, people, and projects to regenerate
 bioregions. It builds capacity and supports local Changemakers and their
 communities, including regenerative farmers, social entrepreneurs, leaders in public
 institutions, corporate leaders, NGOs, students, educators etc., in coordinating

 collective action for the required change on a systemic level. The idea is that an
 inclusive process leads to more local ownership and better implementation of more
 resilient and effective strategies to accelerate the uptake and scaling of regenerative
 practices ‚Äì like agro-ecology, agroforestry, seagrass restoration, and other Nature-
 based Solutions.
 The BWL approach combines the emerging leadership practice of ‚ÄòWeaving‚Äô, with a
 Theory U-inspired lab process and a holistic impact framework to generate 4 Returns
 in the bioregions (natural, social, and financial returns, and the return of inspiration).
 Each BWL is led by one or a small team of dedicated ‚ÄòWeavers‚Äô, often hosted by strong
 local partner organizations, and supported by the international BWL Backbone Team.
 All the bioregional weaving teams across Europe are participating in the overarching
 BWL Learning Network with regular online sessions and an annual Learning Summit to
 catalyze peer-to-peer learning. Apart from the Learning Network, the BWL collective
 is building a growing portfolio of systemic, regenerative innovations and practices
 from all over the world ‚Äì including from Ashoka Fellows ‚Äì that are community-
 based, replicable and scalable, and can inspire and support the bioregions in their
 regenerative landscape development.
 The Bioregional Weaving Labs (BWL) Collective is a growing international alliance that
 currently consists of 30+ organizations, including Ashoka and Commonland, working
 together to mobilize one million Changemakers to restore, protect and regenerate
 one million hectares of land and sea in Europe by 2030. The Collective is representing
 hundreds of practitioners in the field, like farmers and nature conservationists, and has
 the ambition to grow into an international movement of regenerative Changemakers.
 Since January 2022, the Bioregional Weaving Labs Collective has activated
 25 Weavers facilitating 8 BWLs in 8 countries in Europe: Ireland, Germany, The
 Netherlands, Austria, Romania, France, Spain, and Poland.
 BWL South East Ireland
 The BWL in South East Ireland, was one of the first ones to be established and has
 since facilitated a series of place-based trust-building activities as well as regular
 multi-stakeholder workshops with farmers, local institutions and social innovators in
 the bioregion. The workshops are designed to look at systemic and mindset changes
 needed for landscape transformation through collective action, and have proven to be
 a space where isolated initiatives find strength in numbers and a sense of belonging.
 The South East of Ireland is dominated by intensive agricultural practices, mostly dairy
 and beef, supplying a major export market, with smaller areas of upland features along
 the northern edge of the bioregion, and a craggy coastline to the south facing out to
 the Celtic Sea and the Atlantic beyond. The effects of extractive business practices
 and broken food systems are becoming increasingly visible in this superficially green
 and thriving corner of Europe. Water quality is poor in many of the rivers, dairy farming
 has reached a point where the carrying capacity of the land and soil is exceeded, and
 communities are detached from nature, and each other, due to urban growth and shifts
 in social connections in rural settings. There is an increasing awareness of the fragility
 of the situation and the harmful effects of such systems. There is also an increasing
 determination to do something that will restore and regenerate the region, but there is
 little access to knowledge or demonstrations of how to make such a major change.
 An early initiative in the work of the Irish BWL was to give local stakeholders ownership
 of their own vision for the future of their food systems - and the changes that will be
 needed in local natural and social structures to get there. They did this by co-writing this
 powerful manifesto that now guides the direction and content of the BWL work in Ireland.

 The multiple activities and initiatives led by the BWL in South East Ireland represent
 both the tangible and intangible aspects of transformative change. The weaving staff
 support local projects with micro catalyst grants, and by creating shared language
 and sharing tools that facilitate systemic and collective change. Events have included
 landscape walks and artistic interventions, as well as formal workshops and seminars.
 Over the course of 18 months, ten concepts have emerged as being both innovative
 and potentially collectively impactful in their ability to achieve the shared vision in the
 manifesto and contribute to the overall mission of the European BWL collective. The
 concepts range from new kinds of regenerative farming to rural hubs, from upland
 sustainability through generations to unleashing the social capital of the third age116,
 and from a mission-driven geopark to stiching nature corridors together across the
 bioregion.
 In addition, the BWL in South East Ireland is involved in a ‚Äòdeep demonstration‚Äô
 partnership with the Irish government to test landscape approaches to the future of
 sustainable dairy. These activities and approaches mean that the BWL is now in a
 position to i) establish a new entity ‚Äì the Bioregional Weaving Alliance ‚Äì designed to
 support learning and initiatives leading to bioregional regeneration, restoration and
 protection, especially in the South East, and ii) offer a portfolio of emerging concepts for
 holistic investment.
 An emerging portfolio of regeneration projects
 The portfolio of concepts can be thought of as a collection of systemic innovations
 that together can trigger a bioregional transition to local regenerative economies as
 well as thriving landscapes and communities, in line with the manifesto and overall
 BWL mission. The portfolio was developed through residential and local workshops ‚Äì
 including at the evocative localities of Dromana House on the Blackwater river and the
 Coastguard Cultural Centre overlooking Tramore Bay. A major conference was held
 to consider innovative landscape and community financing using the portfolio and the
 support platform of the BWL and its BWL catalyst funds as a case study.
 Currently the 10 concepts are in the process of being matured and developed to
 become fundable and investable as an integrated portfolio of critical interventions for
 the bioregion. The concepts are interdependent and entangled, and the local team
 believes that only when viewed as a whole can investment and finance flows expect to
 address unexpected externalities, risks beyond linear value chains, and the potential of
 holistic aggregated returns. The hope is that investment in such an emergent portfolio
 will catalyze large-scale positive change for communities and for the landscape ‚Äì and
 generate inspiration, social, natural, and financial capital.
 Both the weaving team and local stakeholders are determined to find new ways of
 holistically financing the regeneration of their bioregion through a support structure
 and emergent portfolio that is built on local knowledge and bottom-up decision-making
 and inclusive, equitable governance structures.

 (Radtke et al.: Aging, Identity, and Women: Constructing the Third Age)

3.3 Bioregional Hubs
As early as 1983, legendary systems thinker Donella Meadows envisioned ‚Äú[...]
a number of centers where information and models about resources and the
environment are housed.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúThere would need to be many of these centers,
all over the world, each one responsible for a discrete bioregion. They would
contain people with excellent minds and tools, but they would not be walled off, as
scientific centers so often are, either from the lives of ordinary people or from the
realities of political processes. The people in these centers would be at home with
farmers, miners, planners, and heads of state and they would be able both to listen
to, and talk to, all of them.‚Äù 117

Meadows was outlining the capabilities of an institution that would function as a
place-based knowledge broker and capacity builder to catalyze collaborative action
toward what we now call regenerative economies. She called these institutions
Bioregional Learning Centers (BLCs). Today, there are dozens of such centers118
established around the world ‚Äì like BLC South Devon, UK (see Case Study 3:
The Bioregional Learning Center in South Devon) and BLC Barichara, Colombia.

2. Listening, ongoing and comprehensive systems mapping & research
 Bioregional Hubs are well-positioned to organize listening sessions to tap into
 what regenerators want to focus on in the short, medium, and long-term. In
 many cases, this can and should be based upon positive regenerative land
 use activities already under way in the Bioregion. These activities are often
 underfunded, and may represent existing ‚Äúshovel ready‚Äù projects. Additionally,
 Hubs can carry out ongoing, contextual systems mapping exercises to identify
 which systems the local community wants to work on shifting first, and map a
 strategy for doing so. Hubs can also conduct research programs informed by
 listening sessions and the systems mapping.119

3. Capacity building & upskilling
 New skills and capabilities will be required across sectors to mitigate the
 compounding effects of ecological collapse, and for the regenerative transition
 of economies and societies. Bioregional Hubs can provide the institutional
 framework for the necessary upskilling and capacity building. In addition,
 they can curate programming and education for community members of the
 bioregion as well, strengthening climate resilience and community weaving.120
 Bioregional Hubs can ensure that Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Traditional Ecological

 increasing their likelihood of success, thus de-risking investments.

119 This mapping can highlight interdependencies between systems and can include an assessment of dynamics such
 as feedback loops, tipping points, and leverage points.
120 The hosting and facilitation of trainings and gatherings can be an important revenue stream for Bioregional Hubs.
 Bioregional hubs may also serve as a maker space or co-working space ‚Äì other potential sources of revenue.
121 U.S. National Park Service: Traditional Ecological Knowledge
122 In Social Forestry: Tending the Land as a People of Place, Tomi Hazel Vaarde differentiates between TEK and
 Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK), with TEK being defined as ‚Äúa collection of stories and procedures that
 holds wisdom and pertinence for Place-based culture.‚Äù Vaarde notes that ‚Äúsome TEK survives in epics that have
 been moved through migration, yet still contain resonance in a newly settled Place.‚Äù This differs from IEK which is
 based on an unbroken tradition of land stewardship held by a specific lineage of people in a particular place, usually
 involving regular ritual or ceremonial practices over millennia. In this book, we use the term ‚ÄòIndigenous wisdom‚Äô
 as a more general term that certainly includes IEK, but is not limited to the category of ecology. We suggest that a
 thorough understanding of the term IEK would not consider ecology as something separate from other aspects of
 existence, wisdom, or fields of study, however we use the more general term to limit the risk that readers confine their
 interpretation within a separate category, something the Western mind has been trained to do.
123 Practice of the R Values is critical here. (see Page 70)

4. Identification and incubation/acceleration of regenerative business cases
 Being deeply embedded in a local bioregional context, Bioregional Hubs will
 play a critical role in both identifying and supporting regenerative business
 cases or projects that are aligned with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy.
 Both structured and needs-based programs can support the formation of
 regenerative projects and organizations, and incubate and accelerate them.
 Drawing on their embeddedness in communities and ecosystems, Bioregional
 Hubs will also play a critical role in organizing synergistic portfolios of existing
 and new projects and organizations that BFFs can then invest in. All of this,
 again, will be informed by the land use and systems mapping capabilities
 that Bioregional Hubs can provide. This function supports the development of
 approaches to catalyzing the economic transition.125

6. Curating interfaces with global networks of Bioregional Hubs & Learning
 Centers
 As part of an international network, individual Bioregional Hubs can ensure
 that local experiences are shared beyond the boundaries of the bioregion,
 catalyzing action around the world. Simultaneously, Hubs can draw on the data,
 knowledge, and wisdom in the global network to inform ongoing regenerative
 action and, as a result, financial resource governance. Coordination between
 Hubs can help to establish and share frameworks, optimize operations, channel
 opportunities, and inform data assessment, best practices, and other activities.

 CASE STUDY 3:
 The Bioregional Learning Center in South Devon ‚Äì
 Modeling Bioregional Hubs
 By Isabel Carlisle

 About Bioregional Learning Center South Devon
 Bioregional Learning Center South Devon was founded in 2017 by three designers,
 ecologists and climate activists as a systemic response to the systemic impacts
 of climate change. The Center works creatively and collaboratively in and at the
 intersections of economy, ecology, learning, arts and culture and the gaps in between.
 While the bioregion it covers is South Devon, its projects operate at scales that range

125 Including the building blocks of technological, legal, financial, governance, and other innovation.

 from the whole of the South West, to Devon and down to the Dart catchment, or just a
 stretch of the river.
 Bringing a bioregion into being
 The Center‚Äôs aim is to create a resilient region that functions as a learning landscape
 by making collaboration possible and giving civil society a leading role alongside
 landowners, experts, NGOs, and policy-makers. Because it has received only a small
 amount of unrestricted core funding, the evolution of the Center has been mainly
 through funded projects in which it has honed its way of working. These projects
 represent the steps for bringing a bioregion into being, and are the core functions
 that any Bioregional Learning Center would need to perform.
 1. Develop a story of place - This regenerative design process enabled the Center
 to understand the bioregion it serves, how it functions, and where its edges are. The
 character of a place is revealed by overlaying different lenses, all the way from deep
 geological time, through social and political history, to land use and human culture.
 The pattern that is revealed points to where the fuzzy boundaries of this island of
 coherence lie, and how it relates to its immediately surrounding places and the
 bigger region or nation. See: Story of Place for NW Plymouth.
 2. Reveal the systems within the region - Humans have always lived in webs of
 life-support systems ‚Äì both ecosystems and human systems ‚Äì that meet humanity‚Äôs
 basic needs. Today these systems are typically managed by public utility companies
 and large-scale businesses, and regulated by local authorities and the state. By
 mapping for vitality in its bioregion, getting out on the land and meeting people, the
 Center organizing team developed an understanding of local systems and could
 determine how best to support and connect innovators. See: Learning Journey for
 Climate Resilience.
 3. Intervene and demonstrate - Through leading or participating in projects in
 our bioregion Center members look for creative ways to intervene in systems
 such as the drinking water system. In a move towards common pool resource
 management126 they make sure to bring in the voice of civil society, as well as
 experts, using data, design, the arts, and dialogue to bridge the gap between
 academia, policy makers, and people on the ground. The Center acts as a trusted
 neutral player, with its learning center as a backbone organization. See: Voices of the
 Dart.
 4. Launch a multi-sector design process - The Center grasped the opportunity to
 start a big region-wide conversation in establishing the Devon Doughnut Collective.
 Over a year of fortnightly Zoom meetings, the collective put together an ecological
 and economic assessment of Devon, with twin-track indicators and pathways to
 action for both policy-makers and civil society. The Center hosted the project as an
 action learning endeavor, bringing key change-makers from all sectors into the same
 space to create an interactive Doughnut, available on a dedicated website. See: The
 Devon Doughnut.
 5. Widen reach and impact - The Center is currently embarking on the first steps
 to a climate adaptation strategy for the region, with funding from the regional
 government. In this first year, Center members plan to take elected councilors,
 government staff, community climate groups, and some members of the UK
 adaptation community of practice on a 5-day learning journey around the region,
 to widen the conversation, look at the risks and challenges, and visit the places

126 See Elinor Ostrom‚Äôs 8 Principles for Managing a Commons (Ostrom, 1990).

 and people already making strides towards adaptation. The second part of this
 programme will see the launch of a touring exhibition on climate challenges and
 adaptation. In future years the Center will set up demonstrator projects and a
 learning network for exchanging information locally. All of these activities aim to
 provide capacity building and the upskilling of relevant communities and actors.
 6. Document and showcase your learning region - the center continually converts
 practice into resources to showcase the work, interpret it, and share it, as seen on
 the website. Center members act as ambassadors for the region on public platforms,
 and take part in international bioregional conversations. Data, measuring, and
 working with experts increasingly takes place in a ‚Äòbackroom‚Äô for the bioregion, while
 polycentric governance grows out of building a network of generative relationships
 and trust.
 Growing a funding ecosystem
 BLC is now focusing on designing and prototyping a ‚Äòfunding ecosystem‚Äô in South
 Devon that can build community and ecological wealth through a linked suite of
 philanthropic and investment vehicles that can be replicated elsewhere without the
 need for philanthropic funding. The outcome will not only be a quantifiable return on
 investment expressed through multiple value gain: the Bioregion is also being skilled
 up in climate literacy; enhancing the ability of citizens to collect, interpret and share
 data; and enabling their participation in the governance of the natural systems of the
 bioregion - water, soil, biodiversity, air, and marine habitats.
 The Bioregional funding eco-system will resource, through innovative financial
 instruments, projects that shift the needle on regenerating systems and the
 regeneration activators that are leading them. The Center is setting out to prove
 that there is cascading value, and a return on investment, from working in a joined-
 up bioregional way. The overall impact of all this interlocking action on a whole
 bioregion has not yet been modeled. Nor has it been placed into a landscape-wide
 climate adaptation and resilience plan. The Center believes that the time has come
 to do that and make the model publicly available as part of growing climate literacy.

BFFs do this by working hand in hand with the Bioregional Organizing Team and
Bioregional Hub to enable the decentralization of financial resource governance,
the design of synergistic project portfolios, and the transition to a regenerative
economy. Whereas Bioregional Hubs work to bring together and empower a
bioregional regeneration network by facilitating regenerative flow of all capital
types, BFFs focus specifically ‚Äì but not exclusively ‚Äì on facilitating the regenerative
flow of financial capital. With this focus, and a staff with relevant expertise, BFFs

 that it needs to be able to incorporate the strategy into its governance process once the strategy is created.

(as illustrated in Figure 8.).129 In addition to funding portfolios of regenerative projects
and organizations, BFFs can allocate financial resources to one or more Bioregional
Hubs (as illustrated in Figure 9.). They can also fund the Bioregional Organizing
Team to ensure foundational bioregional organizing work deepens with existing
actors, and widens to include additional actors that are supporting the transition to
a regenerative economy.

rather than more dependent on financial capital overall and financial capital from
outside the region, and where financial flows better align with real flows of value.
However, this aim of localizing and diversifying capital flow must be navigated
carefully within the global historical context in which centuries of colonialism and
neocolonialism have extracted diverse forms of wealth from certain bioregions
and transferred it to others. In places that have grown rich from this extraction, not
only will capital diversification be made easier by the excess material and financial
capital present, but capital localization efforts made without sincere engagement in
decolonial processes of reconciliation, reparation, and healing are likely to further
deepen inequality and injustice. In extracted contexts, the need for outside financial
capital may be more pressing, and the regenerative impact of financial capital may
be greater. Thus, BFFs may offer appropriate infrastructure for forming relationships
of solidarity, rebalancing, and reciprocity between diverse regions with shared
history.130 For example, BFFs might enable Indigenous communities to receive and
manage Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) from Global North countries to
support Indigenous stewardship and the realization of the targets set in the Global
Biodiversity Framework.131

Regeneration Strategy, their structures will vary. Diverse, decentralized
organizations can support increased systemic resilience, and improve the
effectiveness of BFFs as connective tissue.135 Therefore, we do not seek to be overly
prescriptive on how BFFs should be designed. Instead we lay out twelve high-level
attributes our research tells us each facility should work towards, and eventually
meet in order to effectively support the realization of the BFF objectives. We then
introduce templates for BFFs that can serve as a starting place in design.

1. Aim to align with living systems principles and Indigenous wisdom ‚Äì BFFs
 are not meant to be designed as machines to be used for moving money
 between investors and regenerative activities; they are themselves meant to
 serve as regenerative activity. This is a purpose inseparable from the objective
 of catalyzing regenerative economies; thus BFFs should work to embody living
 systems patterns and principles136 in their organizational design and culture.

 makes BFFs unique, in that it focuses their capital on large-scale ecological and
 social regeneration and the realization of cascading benefits through systems
 change. In practice, this means that BFFs will need to prioritize bioregional
 regeneration activities and objectives in order to identify which BFFs to set
 up and in what sequence. From there, the strategy of each BFF should be
 crafted, with both the short and long term aspects of the broader Strategy as
 its objectives. BFFs can create tests to determine whether a given investment
 supports the transition to the regenerative economy,139 including healing and
 reconciliation, or whether it is further entrenching the economy of the bioregion
 in increasingly fragile global supply chains and systems built on extraction and
 destruction.

3. Implement an inclusive and participatory governance structure that
 represents the bioregion ‚Äì It is critical that each BFF has a governance
 structure that is broadly representative of and based on the input of the people
 living and working in the bioregion, the people that have historically stewarded
 land in the bioregion if they have been misplaced, and the more than human life
 in that place. This structure should include management, a board, an investment
 committee, and participatory processes that feed into its decisions and
 operations. The role of the Bioregional Organizing Team to organize and activate
 key bioregional actors is important. Through this trust-building process, the early
 scaffolding of contextually-sound governance structures and practices can be
 built, and appropriate bioregional representatives to serve in BFF governance
 can be identified. The board should be ethnically and culturally representative
 of bioregional residents and their interests. BFFs should pay special attention to
 ensure Indigenous groups and communities that have faced structural violence
 and exploitation are represented in the places where they reside. We also
 recommend the inclusion of more than human life on BFF boards140 to ensure
 that the financial capital raised is not used to narrowly serve human interests,
 but is allocated to benefit all of the life in the bioregion. Additionally, a process
 should be established to have regular input from both youth and elders. We also
 recommend that governance boards rotate periodically in order to bring new
 energy and ideas to BFFs. A bioregion may decide to hold a town hall, citizens
 assembly, or election to select board members at regular intervals (more about
 governance in Section 4.5).

4. Work to shift power imbalances ‚Äì By serving as connective tissue, Bioregional
 Financing Facilities help address the power imbalances often inherent in funder-
 fundee or investor-investee relationships. BFFs should work to address the
 power imbalance between those controlling large amounts of financial capital
 today and those struggling to resource the implementation of their regenerative
 projects. This includes imbalances across bioregions, such as those in places
 that have grown materially rich from colonial extraction and those in places
 that have been extracted from. It also includes imbalances within bioregions,
 such as those created by economic, racial, religious, and gender discrimination
 and violence. The transition to a regenerative economy should lead to a more
 equitable society where well being for all is prioritized.

139 Based on the bioregion‚Äôs vision for the regenerative economy.
140 The rights of nature movement has made progress, particularly since the inclusion of nature‚Äôs rights in Ecuador's
 revised constitution (ratified in 2008), to gain legal recognition of the rights of life other than humans to exist. The Earth
 Law Center, in particular, has been working to elect oceans, rivers, animals, etc. to corporate boards. These entities
 are represented by a human proxy that votes on their behalf.

 BFFs are designed to empower local land, water, and neighborhood stewards
 to implement the strategies they believe are most effective in their place ‚Äì
 recognizing the value of local knowledge in delivering the 4 Returns. One
 practical way they do this is by working together with Bioregional Hubs to
 reduce the burden of applying for grants or securing investment capital, and
 the reporting requirements that come if a project or organization is successful
 in raising capital. Additionally, BFFs can support a shift in the power imbalance
 between humans and the more-than-human world, and promote greater
 harmony in the relationships between all life on the planet. At every level, BFFs
 should work towards restoring ‚Äòright relationship‚Äô ‚Äì rooted in the principles of
 reciprocity and mutualism found in both biology and Indigenous wisdom.141

 sum through many small donations or eco-credit purchases, and local capital to
 mobilize capital from outside of the bioregion.144 BFFs aim to (i) rapidly scale up
 the amount of financial capital flowing to bioregional regeneration; (ii) diversify
 the types of capital used to meet varied financing needs and risk profiles, in an
 integrated capital structure; and (iii) strengthen local value flows. The primary
 objective of the integrated capital structure is not to guarantee investor returns,
 for which blended finance transactions are often criticized, but to strategically
 de-risk, change risk perception, fund synergistic portfolios of projects to drive
 systems change, fund common assets, and stimulate and build markets aligned
 with regeneration.

 change, increasingly referred to as ‚Äòsystemic investing‚Äô,145 and to do so at
 target geographies, benefitting from both diversification and the 4 Returns
 these portfolios will achieve. For investors or companies that want to support
 innovation, the Venture Studio (more details in Section 4.2) can provide
 exposure to innovation from the edges of the system and from the resurgence
 of Indigenous knowledge systems ‚Äì both of which will be critical in building
 resilience in the years to come.

 Potential motivations for investing in bioregional action for philanthropists,
 investors, corporations, governments, or citizens are wide-ranging (and
 are explored in detail in Section 4.3). BFFs enable capital holders to invest
 collaboratively with like-minded funders and financiers. These facilities are
 designed to support and strengthen relationships, including among funders
 and financiers and between funders and financiers and the people, places,
 and changes unfolding in the bioregion. BFFs aim to ensure high levels of
 credibility and to speak the language of finance in order to establish a solid base
 of investor confidence. By bridging community-led governance together with
 current financial industry standards, these facilities also function as important
 interfaces between local initiatives and external investment ‚Äì for example, from
 global capital markets ‚Äì catalyzing their co-evolution.

7. Treat growth and returns as a means, not an end ‚Äì The cycles of growth
 and decay are integral to living systems. BFFs are designed to support the
 transition to a regenerative economy that is rooted in this natural law, and does
 not mistake growth and returns for ends in themselves. There can be no infinite
 growth of a material system within a closed environment of finite materials
 without bringing about its collapse.146 To this end, BFFs recognize that growth
 should not be the purpose of a healthy economy or organization and financial
 returns cannot be the purpose of an investment.147 Financial models, term
 sheets, risk assessment approaches, and broader economic transition plans
 should reflect holistic objectives, deriving from the Bioregional Regeneration
 Strategy and the goals of regenerative organizations. When determining what

 bioregion can help to reduce perceived risk by external investors and enable them to co-invest.
145 See the work of the TransCap Initiative.
146 It should be noted that economic growth is the driving force behind the economic policies of most nation states
 on Earth, and in 2020, Helmut Haberl et al concluded in A systematic review of the evidence on decoupling of GDP,
 resource use and GHG emissions, part II: synthesizing the insights, that ‚Äúlarge rapid absolute reductions of resource
 use and GHG emissions cannot be achieved through observed decoupling rates."

 produce, we recommend BFF leadership apply the principle of the Honorable

 practices that govern the exchange of life for life is
 known as the Honorable Harvest. They are rules of sorts

8. Raise from purpose-aligned funders or investors ‚Äì It will be important to attract
 capital providers of all types who believe in the importance of realizing the
 Bioregional Regeneration Strategy and are willing to try new, more relational
 models for assessing and mitigating risk149 ‚Äì such as social credit scores, trust
 circles, aggregation, and integrated MRV.150 Many bioregions have socio-
 economic conditions that limit access to capital for certain communities based
 on conventional systems of assessing and mitigating risk.151 BFFs should seek
 to engage with capital providers who wish to support the decentralization of
 financial resource governance and the economic transition of the bioregion, and
 are interested in all 4 Returns. Potential motivations and incentives for various
 categories of capital providers are laid out in Section 4.3. The realization of
 bioregional regeneration strategies and success of regenerative organizations
 will depend upon the flexibility offered by purpose-aligned funders to address
 the specific barriers to deploying capital within each bioregion and the
 communities of which they are woven. Growing or deepening the relationship of
 funders and investors with the bioregion will be key to developing alignment.

 for systemic change to facilitate streamlined access to investment for small
 bioregional initiatives, and present an attractive proposition to major funders
 and investors seeking diversified, impactful, and aligned portfolios focused on

 projects and the substantial capital required for meaningful impact at scale. The
 aggregation and matchmaking function also importantly reduces the burden
 on projects and organizations to engage with the bureaucracy inherent in
 government, philanthropy, and impact investment, associated with accessing

148 More about this in Robin Wall Kimmerer‚Äôs book Braiding Sweetgrass.
149 The efficacy of such models has been demonstrated in microlending by the Grameen Bank, BRAC, etc. Additionally
 there are interesting pilots taking place using social risk metrics to finance on-reservation Native American housing in
 the US (Flower Hill Institute).
150 Such aligned capital providers may initially account for a small percentage of capital pools, but the push of
 global efforts to stabilize planetary systems and the pull of BFFs establishing strong track records of bioregional
 regeneration should increase this percentage rapidly by the late 2020s. In addition, significant pools of purpose-
 aligned funding should become available through forthcoming loss and damage and reparations payments.
151 In Indian Country in the US, for example, some of the factors contributing to this risk perception include: tribal
 sovereign powers, inalienability of tribal land, lack of trust and historically poor relationships with colonial financial
 institutions (credit to Atherton Phleger, Flower Hill Institute).
152 When developing portfolios for impact investors, BFFs can focus on a specific asset class to fit into the investor‚Äôs

 capital and reporting on its use. In their role as connective tissue , BFFs are able
 to interface with projects and capital providers, speaking the language of both,
 and meeting the needs of each to help bring them together.
 Due to the unique role networks of local support can play in the success of
 these projects, BFFs may also assist in advancing alternative forms of project
 selection and underwriting.

10. Apply an integrated approach to sensing and MRV ‚Äì BFFs should develop
 MRV strategies that leverage modern technology and Traditional Ecological
 Knowledge (TEK)153 and Indigenous wisdom, quantitative and qualitative
 data, and sophisticated modeling and on-the-ground verification by citizen
 scientists.154 Together with Bioregional Hubs, there is potential for BFFs in a
 bioregion to develop a comprehensive MRV strategy and to share the overhead
 cost of a platform to host this information.155 This platform should include
 project or site-specific data and overall bioregional health data to effectively
 enable tracking of the systemic impact of investments. The platform should be
 managed as a commons and can enable accountability beyond just the projects
 BFFs invest in. Technologies such as eDNA analysis, bioacoustics, remote
 sensing, and life-centered AI156 can support improved sensing, which can
 serve BFFs and bioregional citizens in better sensemaking when applied in an
 integrated framework with TEK, Indigenous wisdom, and citizen science.

 There are several ecological MRV platforms available that bring many datasets
 into one place, that a bioregion might opt to use, together with bottom-up
 metrics.157 Building on attributes 7 and 9, an important efficiency of BFFs is that
 they aggregate MRV, reducing the burden of reporting and due diligence on
 individual projects and investors. These tools have the ability to meet on-the-
 ground projects where they are‚Äîthrough workflows, automation, and locally
 designed interfaces that interoperate with existing tools. This, combined with
 their ease of use, can play a critical transitional role in meeting legacy reporting
 requirements while supporting the emergence of self-determined practices,
 processes, and outcomes.158 These bioregional MRV or sensing platforms can
 leverage the falling costs of sensing technologies159 and become embodied
 intelligence systems, as laid out in Bruno Latour‚Äôs article, Gaia 2.0. In addition to
 supporting community members in their ongoing sensemaking and reducing
 external reporting burdens, community-centered MRV tools and resources,
 such as those offered through Open Future Coalition‚Äôs Open Impact platform,
 provide pathways to generating local economic returns through training and
 compensation for peer-to-peer impact validation.

153 See differentiation between TEK, Indigenous Ecological Knowledge,and Indigenous wisdom in section 3 (Vaarde
 2023).
154 Examples of direct compensation mechanisms for Indigenous communities for species monitoring/tracking include
 Biocultural Jaguar Credits issued on Regen Registry and the Biodiversity Credits issued by Savimbo.
155 An entity like the developing Nature Tech Collective could possibly support BFFs in this area.
156 Active Inference technology might be particularly relevant here since it is based on the cognitive processes of
 humans and other species, embedded in particular geospatial settings, and inherently trackable and traceable
 (Designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles, Karl Friston et al.) . The essay The Gaia Attractor by Rafael
 Kaufmann proposes a planetary AI co-pilot network to address the metacrisis. James Lovelock proposed something
 similar in his last book, Novacene, while Timothy M. Lenton and Bruno Latour‚Äôs influential article Gaia 2.0 suggested
 that humans could add some level of self-awareness to Earth‚Äôs self-regulation (Science, 2018).
157 The Nature Tech Collective has published a Nature FinTech Sector Map that maps organizations with offerings in the
 following areas: monetization, modeling, and measurement and monitoring.
158 Informed by Open Future Coalition‚Äôs experience working with grassroots impact efforts globally to reduce the burden
 of existing reporting requirements while bridging towards community-driven quantitative and qualitative metrics.
159 For example, we have access to higher resolution, more up to date remote sensing data than ever before. The launch
 costs for satellites have fallen 95 percent (with another massive reduction expected in the coming years) thanks to
 reuse, improved engineering, and increased volumes.

11. Invest in storytelling160 ‚Äì Putting finance in service to life requires new,
 compelling stories of value, identity, and place. Extractive finance is built upon
 millenia of stories that are deeply embedded in our culture.161 Both new and
 ancient stories are essential when we are reassessing what we value and
 reorienting our culture and resources toward that. For people on the ground,
 the practicalities, benefits, and beauty of a thriving bioregion can be directly
 experienced. However, when communicating both the tangible local impact
 (e.g. the 4 Returns162) and the more intangible global effects of a distributed
 bioregional movement to non-local investors, robust storytelling is needed.
 BFFs can treat investment as a form of storytelling itself: breathing life into
 stories of action waiting to be told. BFFs can act with the understanding that the
 ways investments are rationalized, structured, and accounted for tell additional
 stories. Through capital raising, capital allocation, and broader marketing and
 communications, it is critical that BFFs nurture and enhance the foundation of
 stories around bioregional history, identity, and shared vision told and developed
 during the initial phases of bioregional organizing (see Section 3). Lastly, BFFs
 can invest in catalytic art and storytelling that enables the scaling of a grassroots
 movement and an economic transition that is only possible through inspiration.

 ‚ÄúThe role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible.‚Äù
 ‚Äì Toni Cade Bambara

12. Engage in partnerships, place-based citizen-stewardship, and the
 community of practice ‚Äì BFFs are embedded in place and in local partnerships.
 To achieve their objectives, BFFs must be built on a strong relational foundation.
 They are set up by the people of a particular place to serve the vision of the
 Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. While they will have their own governance
 boards, management, and investment committees, the facilities should have
 close relationships and overlap with Bioregional Organizing Teams and
 Bioregional Hubs. Regular meetings between entities and ongoing, live feedback
 are important to ensure the success of the co-evolution process laid out in Table
 4. The shared MRV platform can support cooperative sensing and sensemaking
 among these actors. There is potential for a range of MRV-related partnerships
 including with Indigenous communities, academia, companies, NGOs

shares in the businesses they incubate and launch, the Bioregional Venture Studio
may additionally or alternatively be funded with grants. These grants might come
from the private sector in exchange for access to dealflow, or more traditional
philanthropic or government sources.

Once the bioregion reaches a more advanced stage of organizing, activation, and
strategy, where markets for regeneration are forming and projects and businesses
are ready to take investment, the Bioregional Organizing Team or Bioregional Trust
governance team can help to launch a Bioregional Investment Company. This
facility develops Systemic Investment Funds and Bioregional Regeneration Bonds,
which help to scale up the financing of synergistic portfolios of projects (see Section
4.4) through aggregation and matchmaking. An initial Systemic Investment Fund
might focus on a wide variety of businesses. Subsequent funds might be dedicated
to specific components of the economic transition ‚Äì like transitioning the food
system or energy system in the bioregion. Asset class frameworks used by targeted
investors should be taken into account in the portfolio design process.

The Bioregional Bank can be set up in phase 2 or 3, and either before or after
the Bioregional Investment Company. The Bioregional Bank will lend specifically
to organizations providing goods and services aligned with the Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy. It can also provide advisory services. For bioregions that
are interested in developing and issuing complementary currencies,168 including
nature-based currencies, the Bioregional Bank can lead this process, supporting
a shift in perceptions of value in the bioregion. For example, if the Bioregional Bank
issues a currency that is backed by the health of the salmon population or of a key
river flowing through the bioregion, those entities become the basis of the value of
the currency ‚Äì attaching currency value to natural assets on which all the life in the
bioregion depends (see Section 6 for more details on complementary and Nature-
based Currencies). Bioregional Banks can be set up as Community Development
Financial Institutions (CDFIs) or the national equivalent, leveraging federal or other
guarantees to underwrite loans to small businesses and even non-profits, which are
often deemed too risky to lend to (according to traditional credit risk models, which
do not accurately account for systemic risk or the 4 Returns).

The activities for BFFs included in the templates below are options, illustrative of
the range of activities a given facility can support. It is critical that these templates
are applied and adapted by Bioregional Organizing Teams to serve the economic
transition and regeneration that is emergent in a given place. Each facility is
designed to be flexible and modular: some bioregions might choose to combine
multiple functions into one facility. In addition, existing aligned financial vehicles
like CDFIs, charitable trusts, land trusts, Perpetual Purpose Trusts, landscape and
biodiversity-focused private equity funds,169 could be adapted to become BFFs
or operate in partnership with them. Regardless of the functions established and

Table 6. BFF 1 ‚Äì The Bioregional Trust

 BIOREGIONAL TRUST
 Description A trust that acts as a catalytic grant fund. It provides grants to a
 range of synergistic projects and organizations with cascading
 benefits in order to create a strong foundation for bioregional action.

 Legal structure We recommend a non-profit charitable trust or perpetual purpose
 trust structure. An Indigenous nation, tribe, or consortium of
 nations and tribes might have an alternative legal structure they
 choose to use. The Trust could also be an initiative of an existing
 non-profit organization or start as a Donor Advised Fund (DAF), or
 equivalent.

 Building trust The Bioregional Trust is the first Bioregional Financing Facility we
 recommend setting up. We use ‚Äútrust‚Äù to describe both a form of
 social capital and a financial vehicle. These two aspects of ‚Äútrust‚Äù
 must be deeply interwoven in the design and implementation of
 this BFF. The financial capital that flows into this facility should
 be carefully allocated to support the repair and strengthening of
 relational trust in the bioregion.

 Creating a strong The Trust will be responsible for investing in the foundational
 foundation for elements of bioregional organizing and activation. It can fund
 bioregional action any of the activities in stages 2 through 5 of the multi-stakeholder
 bioregional regeneration, Table 4 (Mapping and Analysis,
 Convening and Activation, Co-initiation and Co-creation, and Co-
 evolution) ‚Äì including possibly supporting Bioregional Organizing
 teams. Together with the Bioregional Hub(s), the Trust will be
 responsible for mapping which systems within the bioregion to
 focus on transitioning first and strategically allocating grants to
 support whole ecosystems of organizations that can drive that
 transition. The Trust can also serve as a fiscal sponsor to projects
 in the bioregion that do their own fundraising.

 Capacity building If there are not one or more Bioregional Hubs already in place,
 this is one of the initial activities we recommend the Trust to
 fund. As noted in Section 3, the Hubs will support projects and
 organizations in the bioregion to prepare for investment. Trusts
 can also make grants to projects and organizations directly to
 help them get to the stage where they are operating regenerative
 business models173 or to prepare them for investment.

 Capacity raising The Trust receives philanthropic and public grant capital, as well
 as individual donations. It may introduce a Bioregional Tithing
 program. It is important to note that the public grant capital can be
 sub-national, national, or multilateral, and the Trust may need to
 meet certain criteria to receive these grants. The Trust can play
 an important role in ensuring that large pools of public capital
 (e.g. from loss and damages, reparations, climate, and ecological
 restoration funds) meant to be invested in global public goods or
 common assets are efficiently used and that they reach on-the-
 ground regenerators.

173 Does not require that an organization is profitable, but that it is regenerating itself in terms of its funding/financing
 structure in alignment with the purpose and life cycle of the organization. This approach acknowledges regenerative
 organizations might have a death date at which they choose to end their operations.

 Capital allocation It provides grants to fund key processes of multi-stakeholder
 bioregional regeneration (including what is often referred to
 ‚Äúthe spaces in between‚Äù ‚Äì organizing, convening, relationship
 building, art, learning & integration, etc.) and to priority projects
 and organizations aligned with the Bioregional Regeneration
 Strategy. As mentioned above, grants can be allocated through
 a participatory budgeting process including voting as part of a
 prize model (such as the Edge Prize ‚Äì see case study), through
 Quadratic Voting (such as in the Golden Bay bioregion ‚Äì see case
 study), or Quadratic Funding (see Section 6 for examples). The
 Trust can also set up and/or seed the Bioregional Venture Studio,
 Bioregional Investment Company and Bioregional Bank.

 Eco-credits:174 both The Trust can work with key bioregional actors to develop,
 capital raising and bundle, and sell eco-credits (including, importantly, to companies
 allocation operating in the bioregion or companies that have historically
 contributed to extraction or destruction in that bioregion). A
 platform like the Regen Marketplace (see the Regen Network
 case study) can enable the development of a methodology
 aligned with the priority regeneration activities in a given
 bioregion. This methodology should be developed through a
 participatory, transparent process. Once the methodology is
 agreed upon and approved by the platform of choice, the Trust
 can support regenerators from across the bioregion to engage
 in designated activities. As discussed above, the integrated MRV
 capabilities of the Trust will enable it to track credit delivery, and
 bundle and issue credits accordingly. Proceeds will then flow to
 regenerators ‚Äì perhaps with the Trust taking a small fee to cover
 its services.

 We see this as an effective approach to scaling up strategic,
 decentralized action quickly to drive regeneration. This tool
 could be used to drive long-term outcomes like watershed
 restoration or species recovery, but could also be used to drive
 rapid fire risk mitigation activities in advance of the fire season
 in a bioregion, for example. An important part of this process will
 be cultivating relationships with potential eco-credit buyers ‚Äì
 noting that there is not yet strong demand for eco-credits beyond
 ICROA-certified carbon credits, which do not take into account
 a holistic composition of biocultural factors. The potential for
 eco-credits to connect corporations operating in a bioregion with
 regenerators stewarding that bioregion is significant. We believe
 that the voluntary carbon market is ripe for disruption, and that a
 bottom-up, bioregional, approach to credit development could be
 catalytic in driving financial resources to regeneration. We have
 already seen a regulated carbon market prioritize credits aligned
 with a locally developed methodology ‚Äì in the case of Quer√©taro,
 Mexico175 and the role that the Sierra Gorda Reserve played in
 shaping the legislation.

174 Attestations about ecological state which prove regeneration is occurring, has occurred, or will occur. It is our
 recommendation that eco-credits are based on community-developed and governed definitions of regeneration,
 which are rooted in context and include a composition of ecological factors (rather a single parameter, such as
 carbon) (adapted from input from Regen Foundation). A reflection from Gregory Landau of Regen Network on the term
 eco-credit here: To Credit, or Not to Credit.

 Common Asset The Bioregional Trust can serve as a Common Asset Trust ‚Äì
 Trusts: both holding the rights to manage key ecosystems in the bioregion as
 capital raising and commons. In their 2021 paper, Robert Costanza et al. lay out how
 allocation forests, watersheds, mountains, and other parts of the biosphere
 can be held in a trust that charges fees to those who take from
 the commons and compensates those that regenerate it.176
 The Bioregional Trust is well suited to support ‚Äúrecommoning‚Äù
 ‚Äì the transition of land from private ownership to commons
 management. It can also support more effective management
 of common assets by leveraging the bioregional MRV platform
 to track use or degradation, as well as regeneration. Eco-credits
 can support the compensation for the regeneration of common
 assets. Legal structures aligned with the rights of nature and
 self-sovereign nature could be applied in a Common Asset Trust
 structure.177
 Ecological Recent innovations in rights of nature have created legal legibility
 Institutions: both for ecosystems and more-than-human species. Innovation in
 capital raising and the Web3 space has paved the way for economic legibility to be
 allocation layered on top of this legal layer ‚Äì enabling bodies of nature to
 have their own blockchain addresses. A Bioregional Trust could
 set up an Ecological Institution with a blockchain address for a
 watershed or buffalo herd and could raise capital into a wallet at
 that address to be allocated to improve the health of that body of
 nature (more about this in the Regen Network Case Study). People
 will be elected as proxies or guardians for the body of nature
 to determine how capital should be allocated. Technological
 tools and Indigenous wisdom will both have an important role
 in supporting sensing of ecosystem health and resulting capital
 allocation decisions. This can change from a fully automated
 Ecological Institution that acts based on data inputs about
 ecosystem or species health to a ‚ÄúConvivial Ecological Institution‚Äù
 that relied more on human sensing of an ecosystem and its
 inhabitants.178

Table 7. BFF 2 ‚Äì The Bioregional Venture Studio

 BIOREGIONAL VENTURE STUDIO
 Description It takes an ecosystemic view of a bioregion to identify critical
 projects, initiatives, and businesses that are required to achieve the
 Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. It then supports the synergistic,
 coordinated development of one or multiple cohorts of regenerative
 organizations to drive systems change. These organizations
 provide investment dealflow for the Bioregional Investment
 Company.

 Legal structure A non-profit, public benefit corporation, co-operative, steward-
 owned entity, perpetual purpose trust, or DAO. The Venture Studio
 could also start as a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) or equivalent.

 Innovation Through identifying key opportunities for a cohort to drive
 bioregional regeneration and resilience and facilitating their
 co-learning and development, the Venture Studio enables
 organizations to create change greater than the sum of their
 parts. This will involve supporting the discovery of various
 approaches to catalyzing the economic transition and aligned
 market development. It can incubate or accelerate organizations
 of various types of legal structures including Indigenous
 economic entities, perpetual purpose trusts, Decentralized
 Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Natural Asset Companies
 (NACs), commons management organizations, co-operatives,
 self-sovereign ownership, and multi-species governance
 organizations. It can support entrepreneurs in applying legal
 structures that support worker ownership, rights of nature, and
 expansion of the commons. The Studio can connect buyers
 engaging in the supply shed179 with entrepreneurs who can help
 address their business challenges ‚Äì particularly related to the
 risks associated with ecological degradation and climate change.

 Capital raising Possibilities for funding the Venture Studio include philanthropic
 or public grants, grants from corporations wanting to make
 investments in supply shed resilience and to develop future
 dealflow,180 founders‚Äô equity, studio-level equity, revenue sharing
 agreements, or option pools.

 Capacity allocation The Bioregional Venture Studio will invest in and incubate or
 accelerate cohorts of early-stage organizations focused on
 key opportunities for bioregional regeneration and resilience.
 It will support innovation that can drive economic transition
 and catalyze new markets. Each cohort will focus on shifting a
 particular system and will work to build an ecosystem of actors
 that can work synergistically to drive that change ‚Äì rooted in
 coordinated, strategic action.

179 We use this term rather than ‚Äúsupply chain‚Äù, noting that materials do not flow in a linear process, but rather more like
 a watershed.
180 This investment could come from the sustainability, R&D, operations, or even the marketing budget within a
 corporation.

Examples of similar ‚Ä∫ Hawai‚Äòi Investment Ready Initiative ‚Äì an accelerator program
entities for social enterprises in Hawai‚Äòi, supporting thematic,
 systems-based cohorts of enterprises with access to

 ‚Ä∫ ProjectTogether ‚Äì an open social innovation accelerator
 catalyzing thematic cohorts of innovators and connecting
 them to other changemakers (public & private) in Germany.
 ‚Ä∫ Fresh Ventures ‚Äì a Dutch venture studio focused on

 grow community capacity to implement ‚Äúequity-centered,
 nature-based climate solutions to some of the most pressing
 climate change challenges facing communities.‚Äù

Table 8. BFF 3 ‚Äì The Bioregional Investment Company

BIOREGIONAL INVESTMENT COMPANY
Description An organization that develops a portfolio of Systemic Investment
 Funds ‚Äì leveraging an integrated capital approach and
 aggregating portfolios of synergistic, high-impact projects or
 businesses with cascading benefits.

Legal structure It can take various forms, including a public benefit corporation
 (where the majority of shares might be owned by the Bioregional
 Trust or another affiliated non-profit, this could also function as a
 holding company), co-operative, steward-owned entity, revolving
 fund, evergreen fund, perpetual purpose trust, Indigenous
 economic entity, or a Decentralized Autonomous Organization
 (DAO). These structures can involve an ‚Äúexit to community‚Äù
 structure where the community purchases the assets after a set
 time period.

 It is important that this company is legally mandated to serve
 the thriving of all life in the bioregion and is majority owned by
 people working towards that goal, and perhaps by the more-than-
 human life there as well. Beyond this, there is a lot of potential
 for innovation and prototyping with this BFF. As compared to
 the others, it possibly has the most significant potential to raise
 financial resources and create a shift in how those resources are
 owned and governed.

Systemic Investment Funds

Legal structure GP-LP structure or DAO with a capped return structure where the
 fund owns equity in projects or businesses, which it may buy, hold,
 resell to another investor, resell to the community, or gradually sell
 back to the founders through profit-sharing.

 A percentage of profits should flow into the Trust, future funds,
 and/or the Venture Studio. This model recognizes that any
 organization in the bioregion turning a profit is benefitting from
 the commons, and is designed to invest in collective assets on
 an ongoing basis. Long-term equity will play an important role in
 building new infrastructure (built, social, or IT) or a new market.

 Innovation As with the overall Bioregional Investment Company, there is
 significant room for innovation in how these funds are structured ‚Äì
 including from fund to fund. For innovative approaches, tools, and
 templates that these facilities could leverage, explore Section 6.

 Governance The management of the Investment Company and a
 representative from the Trust should serve as the GPs and should
 represent the interests of the bioregion. The GPs will be tasked
 with deploying financial resources in service to the Bioregional
 Regeneration Strategy.

 Capital raising Systemic Investment Funds can raise market-rate investment
 capital, concessional capital, or supply chain finance. The GPs will
 develop the term sheet for each fund based on market analysis
 and financial modeling to determine the returns priority investee
 projects or businesses can likely generate.181 Therefore, target
 returns will stem directly from those projects and businesses
 aligned with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy.
 The primary objective of the integrated capital structure is
 not to guarantee investor returns, for which blended finance
 transactions are often criticized, but to strategically de-risk,
 change risk perception, fund common goods that projects or
 organizations may generate, and stimulate and build markets
 aligned with regeneration as a result.

 Large investors might choose to invest in a range of different
 funds in neighboring bioregions, around the world, or focused on
 a particular sector or thematic vertical. By creating an opportunity
 for investors to gain exposure to portfolios of diversified, yet
 connected, high impact, regenerative projects, Systemic
 Investment Funds are filling an existing gap in the impact investing
 market. For further details on our current thinking regarding
 systemic portfolios, see Section 4.4.

 Capital allocation Invests in diversified portfolios of projects and businesses
 designed to create systemic impact. Requires consultation
 of a local expert group (e.g. from Bioregional Hubs) to define
 interdependencies and leverage points in portfolios (see the case
 study below on the Hawai‚Äòi Investment Ready Initiative). These
 funds will apply financial and systems analytics that enable them
 to move beyond the widely applied modern portfolio theory, which
 is a theory of speculation based on backward-looking data that
 suggests investors have no way to address systemic risks. This is
 not reflective of the real social, ecological, economic, and financial
 risks we are facing as the polycrisis unfolds, and disregards the
 leverage that lies in systemic capital allocation.

 Examples of similar While we have not yet seen Systemic Investment Funds
 entities operational the way we describe them here, some existing
 initiatives demonstrate certain elements of it, including:
 ‚Ä∫ AquaSpark ‚Äì an open-ended investment fund building a
 synergistic demonstration portfolio of companies across the
 aquaculture value chain to take pressure off the oceans.
 ‚Ä∫ TransCap and Centre for Public Impact: Urban Climate
 Finance ‚Äì a proposal for a systemic funding architecture
 bringing systemic investing to the challenge of funding urban
 transformation.

181 This Regenerative Term Sheet developed by the Regenerative Investing Institute can serve as a starting place for BFF
 management teams.

 ‚Ä∫ Seed Commons ‚Äì a network of 30 ‚Äúlocally-rooted, non-
 extractive loan funds‚Äù across the US. Seed Commons takes in
 investment as a single fund, then onlends to local funds who
 lend to marginalized communities.
 ‚Ä∫ The Ujima Fund ‚Äì ‚Äúa democratic investment vehicle‚Äù that
 lends to small businesses and real estate and infrastructure
 projects led by members of Boston‚Äôs working-class Black,
 Indigenous, and other communities of color. The Fund uses
 a participatory budgeting process in combination with
 traditional underwriting to ‚Äúput economic development
 decisions in the hands of community members.‚Äù

 Bioregional Regeneration Bonds

 Legal structure A series of privately issued fixed income instruments that fund
 portfolios of qualifying regeneration activities in a bioregion. The
 bonds are issued by the Bioregional Investment Company and
 could be structured similarly to municipal bonds.182

 Governance The Bioregional Investment Company will set the terms for the
 bond. These will be based on the portfolio of priority projects
 identified through the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy, public
 consultations, and market analysis. The management of the
 Bioregional Investment Company will oversee relationships
 with investee projects and investors. If there is cooperation with
 municipal or sub-national authorities, the management will also
 oversee these relationships.

 Capital raising The bonds can be structured similarly to municipal bonds and
 tap into the sizable, tax-advantaged municipal bond market,
 which includes institutional investors. They can raise market-rate
 investment capital or concessional capital. It is also possible for
 Central Banks to purchase these bonds to address the myriad
 economic and financial risks emanating from destruction of the
 biosphere.

 These bonds can leverage innovative structures, for example by
 linking to bioregional regeneration targets in a structure known
 as a ‚Äúsustainability-linked bond.‚Äù If regeneration targets are
 met, the borrower pays a lower interest rate. This enables the
 sharing of the financial value of risk reduction that comes with
 regeneration.183 The MRV platform BFFs build will be an important
 enabler to setting and monitoring such targets.

 Capital allocation The Bioregional Investment Company will identify and allocate
 capital to a portfolio of synergistic projects that together drive a
 particular part of the economic transition or address an ecological
 need in the bioregion. The bond will be purchased by return
 seeking investors, so the underlying assets should generate a
 financial return. For common asset projects, such as large-scale
 infrastructure or ecosystem regeneration projects, it is possible for
 the Bioregional Investment Company to work with local authorities
 to collect taxes to pay for both the principal and interest on the
 bond.

182 A similar bond could also be issued by a municipal or sub-national authority.
183 The World Bank has developed a Feasibility-AmBitiousness (FAB) Matrix for sovereign sustainability-linked bond
 criteria, which can be used to guide bioregional target setting.

 Examples of similar ‚Ä∫ DC Water Green Bond ‚Äì an Environmental Impact Bond
 entities issued by the DC Water and Sewer Authority in 2016.
 The funds raised paid for green infrastructure to support
 stormwater management across the city. The payout on
 the bond was linked to the ecological performance of the
 underlying projects. If the projects outperform the target,
 the investors receive a premium on the base rate and if the
 targets are missed, the investors will receive a discount on
 the base rate, and in some cases could lose some of the loan
 principal.184

 CASE STUDY 4:
 Hawai‚Äòi Investment Ready Initiative ‚Äì An
 Intermediary for Investing in a Resilient Economy
 for All Hawai‚Äòi

 About the Hawai‚Äôi Investment Ready Initiative
 In the heart of the Pacific, Hawai‚Äòi grapples with the delicate balance between
 economic prosperity and ecological preservation, especially considering its
 vulnerability to climate change and the fragility of its ecosystems. Against this
 backdrop, the "Hawai‚Äòi Investment Ready" (HIR) initiative has emerged ‚Äì charting
 a pioneering course in bioregional financing. HIR is a collaborative effort between
 government agencies, environmental organizations, and private investors, that seeks
 to redefine the relationship between economic development and ecological well-
 being.
 HIR was established in 2013 as the first Indigenous-led social enterprise accelerator
 program in the United States. It has supported businesses spanning diverse sectors,
 including renewable energy, eco-tourism, sustainable agriculture, and marine
 conservation. Community engagement is integral to the ethos of HIR, and the selection
 process of businesses to support ensures that local voices inform decision-making,
 fostering a sense of shared responsibility for economic and ecological outcomes.
 Growing a more resilient economy
 In 2017, HIR started pioneering the field of impact investing in Hawai‚Äòi, spearheading
 efforts to educate funders and investors on this approach to financing social
 enterprises. Through the impact investments that HIR catalyzed by linking impact
 investors with viable and promising impact ventures, it has played a pivotal role in
 diversifying Hawai‚Äòi‚Äôs economy, reducing dependence on traditional industries and
 fostering a more resilient economic landscape. Green jobs have been created across
 various sectors and skills development programs were developed to equip the local
 workforce for emerging opportunities in the green economy.
 The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 spurred another significant shift

184 A case study on this bond is available in the World Bank report Mobilizing Private Finance for Nature on page 49.

 within HIR. Needing to address the compounding challenges posed by climate
 breakdown, the organization decided to advance from merely supporting incremental
 improvements within individual enterprises to catalyzing transformational shifts
 across entire systems. It became evident that the escalating complexity of these
 challenges demanded equally intricate solutions. The new holistic Theory of Change
 became:

 ‚ÄúWhen we accelerate the coordination and
 collaboration of capital to seed and scale systemic
 solutions, we are investing in Hawai‚Äòi's economic
 transformation.‚Äù

 In 2022, HIR launched its first prototype in shifting systems, focused on the vertical
 of Hawai‚Äôi‚Äôs food systems. This endeavor commenced with a redesign of its social
 enterprise accelerator program to take a systems change approach. Transforming
 Hawai‚Äòi‚Äôs Food Systems Together conducted an exhaustive systems mapping
 exercise, meticulously identifying interdependencies, feedback loops, and potential
 leverage points. HIR leveraged this work in the redesign of its approach. It became
 clear that various interventions would require a coordinated investment approach
 between different types of capital, however, an accompanying ‚ÄòHawai‚Äòi Capital Scan‚Äô
 report revealed that financial resources remained siloed with limited collaboration
 taking place between diverse capital holders. Consequently, HIR initiated
 conversations with food system investors within its network and helped them solve
 the problems of a) managing risks, b) creating leverage, and c) placing the best bets
 in this complex investment environment by initiating collaboration and de-siloing the
 capital stack. As a side effect, this also helped to level power hierarchies between
 investors and investees in the face of a shared purpose.
 Catalyzing regenerative investments
 Emerging as a strategic intermediary, HIR discerns the optimal deployment of
 funds to effectively drive systemic change. By identifying where different types of
 capital could be best utilized within the capital stack, HIR significantly enhanced its
 value proposition for all stakeholders involved. The next step for HIR is to track the
 investment portfolios against a set of systemic metrics and to effectively fund the
 health of entire ecosystems.
 Co-initiated by HIR, the ‚ÄòƒÄina Aloha Economy Fund is Hawai ªi‚Äôs first catalytic capital
 fund integrating HIR‚Äôs program expertise and research with the work of ‚ÄòƒÄina Aloha
 Economic Futures, a partnering initiative around which 2,600+ community members
 and organizations have coalesced to develop a vision for Hawai ªi ªs economic future.
 Offering adaptable, patient, and risk-tolerant debt capital, the Fund addresses
 the critical capital gap between initial grants or startup funding and commercial
 capital. It helps to smooth over the capital stack allowing investors ª capital to work
 better together. This strategic approach provides a necessary runway for systems
 entrepreneurs, particularly those focused on Native-led and sustainable foodways,
 to implement their strategies for fostering a more equitable and regenerative island
 economy. In addition to financial support, the Fund is committed to enhancing the
 success of these enterprises by offering ongoing technical assistance and help to
 navigate resources and other financial providers.
 Beyond catalyzing funds and investment across the capital stack, HIR has recognized
 the important role of policy and advocacy work in order to win a supportive enabling

 environment for bioregional investments. It is thus actively collaborating with
 other institutions to facilitate conversations between funders, entrepreneurs, and
 policymakers.
 As an intermediary at the intersection of systems change and capital allocation,
 HIR currently operates on catalytic grant capital from philanthropy, distinct from the
 investments made in for-profit ventures and not-for-profit projects within its cohorts.
 HIR aims to transform Hawai‚Äòi‚Äòs systems (such as food & agriculture, housing &
 real estate, etc.) and to serve as an example of how a non-profit can catalyze the
 transition to a regenerative economy. In its own words, HIR describes this ambition as
 ‚Äúbecoming a fractal of what could happen in a more holistic global financial system.‚Äù

Table 9. BFF 4 ‚Äì The Bioregional Bank

 BIOREGIONAL BANK
 Description A Bioregional Bank that provides low-interest loans, microloans,
 lines of credit, and technical assistance to aligned organizations
 (including corporations, for-purpose businesses, non-profit
 organizations, and co-ops). The Bioregional Bank can also provide
 retail banking services to individuals and can develop and issue a
 complementary or nature-based currency.

 Legal structure We recommend the Bioregional Bank is set up as a bank, public
 bank, Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), non-
 profit,185 a publicly-owned entity (owned by the bioregion), or a
 credit union (with partial ownership by the Bioregional Trust and
 investors) under the relevant national jurisdiction.

 Leveraging debt As a bioregion transitions to a regenerative economy, it might
 financing to eventually wish to have its own bank. One initial option would be
 enable economic to establish this Bioregional Bank as a CDFI. The long track record
 transformation of CDFIs and all of the hard work of their champions provide a
 roadmap for the path that Bioregional Banks could take. There
 are many examples of CDFIs supporting the development of 4
 Returns, and indeed, the mission of CDFIs is aligned with many
 of the attributes of BFFs. CDFIs have successfully leveraged
 public capital or attained public guarantees to mobilize private
 investment,186 based on a model that empowers the CDFI to use
 flexible underwriting criteria to assess loan applications, enabling
 the use of relational information and local knowledge to guide risk
 assessment/management and capital allocation.

 Difference from A Bioregional Bank has two main differences from a conventional
 traditional CDFIs CDFI: (i) It takes a systemic approach to lending, aligned with
 achieving the vision of the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy
 and (ii) it may issue a complementary currency. Its capitalization
 structure may also reflect a bioregional focus.

185 There are multiple types of CDFIs including banks, credit unions, loan funds, and venture capital funds.
186 CDFIs leverage an estimated $12 of private capital for every $1 of public investment (CDFI Coalition).

 Capital raising Bioregional Banks can raise philanthropic grants, public grants,187
 concessionary investment capital, and investment capital via
 deposits from individuals or organizations. Importantly, Bioregional
 Banks, like their CDFI counterparts, will seek to leverage
 guarantees. Some impact investors invest in portfolios of CDFIs
 and could do the same with Bioregional Banks. Organizations like
 the Native CDFI Network188 could be helpful to partners as they
 assist Bioregional Banks in raising capital.

 Capital allocation Bioregional Banks can provide low interest loans or revolving lines
 of credit to aligned organizations. They will also be able to offer
 technical assistance.

 Currency For bioregions that are interested in developing a complementary
 development currency (including nature-based, energy-based, or community
 currencies), the Bioregional Banks can design and issue this
 currency to support a more contextual, relational, and dynamic
 approach to valuation and value flow within the bioregion (see
 more about this in Section 6.2). Such a currency can incentivize
 biocultural regeneration. By creating its own currency, a bioregion
 can also create more economic sovereignty and resilience
 ‚Äì possibly moving towards managing its own values-aligned
 monetary policy.189 Complementary currencies have been shown
 to reduce dependence on external capital over time.190

 Examples of similar ‚Ä∫ CDFIs are mission-driven financial institutions dedicated to
 entities serving marginalized communities. As of 2022, more than
 1,300 certified CDFIs across the United States held nearly
 $247 billion in total assets (Federal Reserve Bank of San
 Francisco). Their primary goal is to promote economic
 development, increase access to capital, and address
 financial gaps in areas where traditional financial institutions
 may not adequately serve. CDFIs originated in the United
 States, but similar entities exist in other countries under
 different names and structures. Microfinance institutions,
 development finance institutions, cooperative banks, credit
 unions, mutual organizations and social investment funds can
 serve a similar purpose.
 ‚Ä∫ Spruce Root (see Case Study 5) ‚Äì an Indigenous-led CDFI in
 Alaska that supports Indigenous-owned businesses through
 providing low interest loans and technical assistance.
 ‚Ä∫ Walden Mutual Bank ‚Äì a local bank that invests deposits in
 food systems change in New England and New York through
 offering strategically designed loans to support regenerative
 farming.

187 In addition to the US CDFI Fund, several states in the US have introduced funds dedicated to capitalizing CDFIs. Other
 governments have similar lending programs or can consider creating a national or multiple subnational funds to
 capitalize BCDFIs.
188 Organizations like this have a track record that enables them to qualify for federal funding. The Native CDFI Network
 was recently selected to receive a Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) award of $400M from the
 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This award will enable the Native CDFI Network to support 63 community lenders
 across Indian Country to fund ‚Äòrenewable energy, energy-efficient upgrades, and sustainability projects that will
 enhance well-being and create employment opportunities for Native people.‚Äô
189 Many communities around the world wish to move away from the use of currencies that hinge on an infinite growth
 paradigm.

 CASE STUDY 5:
 Spruce Root ‚Äì An Indigenous-led CDFI Catalyzing a
 Regenerative Economy
 By: Alana Peterson, Kalah Duncan, and India Rose Matharu-Daley

 Spruce Root
 Founded in 2012, Spruce Root is a CDFI based in Juneau, AK, that works to empower
 Alaskan Natives, Indigenous peoples, rural populations and communities across
 Southeast Alaska through equitable economic development. Spruce Root serves 23
 communities from Yakutat in the north to Hydaburg in the south.
 Spruce Root's core programs encompass small business lending, comprehensive
 business education, and personalized coaching services.These initiatives are aimed
 at building organizational capacity, enabling locally-driven enterprises to strengthen
 Southeast Alaska's economy, promote inclusivity, generate quality employment
 opportunities, and foster community well-being. In addition to entrepreneurial support,
 Spruce Root provides technical assistance and facilitation services to support
 regenerative collaboration between public, private, and Indigenous stakeholders.
 Spruce Root was founded with $500,000 in seed funding from the Sealaska
 Corporation, one of a dozen regional Alaska Native corporations created in 1971
 by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). Owned by more than 26,000
 Tling√≠t, Haida, and Tsimshian shareholders, Sealaska‚Äôs mission is to strengthen its
 people, culture, and homelands by creating economic prosperity and protecting the
 environment. Sealaska owns and manages 362,000 acres of land on behalf of its
 Indigenous constituents, and dominated the timber industry in the region until 2021,
 when it renounced commercial logging (Resneck et al., 2023). Now, Sealaska has set
 aside 176,000 acres of Tongass rainforest for carbon sequestration in partnership
 with The Nature Conservancy (Woocheen, no date). The seed funding for Spruce Root
 came from sales of the resulting carbon credits.
 Spruce Root's business development programs
 Spruce Root's small business lending program targets entrepreneurs who may not
 have access to affordable capital through traditional financing channels. However,
 the program remains open to considering applicants who contribute to economic
 development and community well-being in the region. Before potential borrowers
 apply for a loan, Spruce Root provides business and career coaching, and supports
 them after the loan is issued. The loans can fund startup capital, working capital,
 business expansion, and more. Between 2012 and 2022, Spruce Root deployed

 $1.2 million in loan capital and, in 2022, it issued loans to four Alaska small businesses
 totaling $350,000. In 2023 new loans deployed amounted to just under $900,000.
 Outside the small business lending program, Spruce Root offers business coaching
 to other stakeholders. For example, in 2022, Spruce Root provided business basics
 training to Tlingit and Haida citizens, and partnered with Sealaska Heritage Institute on
 developing a business curriculum for Alaska Native artists.
 Spruce Root also organizes workshops and competitions for Southeast Alaska
 entrepreneurs. Its Path to Prosperity business development competition supports
 local businesses that have positive social, economic, and ecological impact and
 promote the regenerative use of the region‚Äôs resources. In 2022, the competition
 attracted 23 applications from eight communities. The 12 finalists attended an
 in-person Business Boot Camp, and received 26+ hours of training and technical
 assistance from 14 mentors.
 In addition, Spruce Root supports Southeast Alaska communities through
 strategic planning and workforce development. In 2022, it finalized and took part in
 implementing a five-year strategic plan for the Sitka Tribe of Alaska and began to
 facilitate an update of the comprehensive community plan for Yakutat in partnership
 with the local government. Spruce Root also provided one-on-one careers coaching
 for 10 people from multiple sectors, and led various workshops and training across
 the region for youth employment and leadership.led an internship program for
 young people at Sealaska, and collaborated with the Sitka Tribe of Alaska on a youth
 employment program. For more information see Spruce Root 2022 Annual Report.
 Sustainable Southeast Partnership (SSP)
 The Sustainable Southeast Partnership (SSP), a program of Spruce Root and
 Sealaska, is a regional network based on a collective impact model. The SSP aims
 to foster collaborative, community-driven initiatives that address complex social,
 ecological, and economic challenges in the region in accordance with Indigenous
 values. Any individual, organization, business, or government can join, and the
 network includes Tribal governments, Native corporations and entities, community-
 minded organizations, state and federal agencies, local businesses, and more.
 The SSP appoints community catalysts hosted by village-level entities to conduct
 community assessments of energy, food, and natural resource and economic
 sustainability. The community catalysts identify projects, which range from food
 security and energy independence to habitat restoration and more, and work with
 regional catalysts on project design, implementation, and monitoring. Regional
 catalysts also work to influence the policy environment and develop economic
 cooperatives and social support networks, and organize workshops and training.
 Seacoast Trust
 Spruce Root is the fiscal sponsor of the Seacoast Trust, a permanent funding
 mechanism created to provide access to capital for Indigenous-led conservation
 projects that place local communities at the center of efforts to achieve a healthy
 environment. The Seacoast Trust guiding principles include respecting community
 voices, upholding Indigenous governance and leadership, and valuing the integrity of
 all knowledge systems, including those anchored in 10,000 plus years of Indigenous
 history, traditions, and stewardship.
 The Seacoast Trust will fund the work of the Sustainable Southeast Partnership.
 Projects slated for funding by the trust include Native forest partnerships, healthy
 salmon habitat, Indigenous Guardians programs, youth leadership opportunities,

 food sovereignty, climate migration, regenerative economies, and reduced carbon
 footprints (Seacoast Trust Annual Report, 2023). The Trust provides grants for work
 programs, loans for small Tribal businesses, Southeast Tribal Land Purchases,
 and local infrastructure projects, and exchange-traded and impact fund, as well as
 network coordination and capacity building. Along with Spruce Root, the Seacoast
 Trust also funds the work of the Sustainable Southeast Partnership.
 In 2022, the Seacoast Trust reached an initial $20M funding goal with the help of
 Sealaska, The Nature Conservancy, and the Rasmuson, Hewlett, Edgerton, Chorus,
 and Wilburforce foundations (The Nature Conservancy, 2021). The goal of the trust is
 to reach $100M in order to fully fund the work of Sustainable Southeast Partnership in
 perpetuity.

4.3 Capitalization of Bioregional Financing
 Facilities
As shown in Table 5, we recommend a phased approach to setting up Bioregional
Financing Facilities, starting with Bioregional Trusts. In Table 10., below, we lay out
the types of capital that can be mobilized to capitalize BFFs, the expected returns,
examples of aligned activities, and the potential investment rationale behind it.
Table 10. is meant to serve as inspiration. The rationale for investing in bioregional
regeneration is emergent, and will be developed through prototypes in many places
and critically, through telling new stories about value and about the relationship
between financial capital, the entities that hold it, and bioregions.

One near-term, high-impact way BFFs can support the flow of financial resources
at scale to regeneration is through being set up to receive the $20 billion in ODA
countries in the Global North have pledged to provide to countries in the Global
South by 2025 (under Target 19), in support of achieving the ecological and social
targets set in the Global Biodiversity Framework. BFFs could also support capital
allocation of Brazil‚Äôs $600 million Amazon Fund (Reuters 2024). Bioregional Trusts
designed to receive and allocate this funding can be built in key biodiversity areas
and Indigenous territories. Allocating funds through BFFs can reduce overhead
costs, bureaucracy, time lags, and corruption and can also help to address
problematic power dynamics often at play between governments and multilaterals
and the grassroots efforts they are seeking to resource.

195 An example is the US Inflation Reduction Act (passed in 2022) that allocated $3 billion in environmental and climate
 justice block grants and $1.3 billion in neighborhood access and equity grant programs to promote community
 resilience and access to safe, affordable transportation. An additional $40B was allocated for environmental justice.
196 One program seeking to address this, that is still highly centralized, is the EPA- and DOE-supported Environmental
 Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Center. BFFs could work together with this Center to improve its
 efficacy.
197 One such tool is the Accelerate Resilience Los Angeles (ARLA) Living Infrastructure Field Kit (developed by Spherical
 Studios), which enables communities to engage in the infrastructure design process from the start to ensure their
 vision is at the center of restoration activities in the Los Angeles River basin in order to deliver health and vitality for
 the people and more than human life there.

200 A donor-advised fund is a charitable account, whereby donors make irrevocable, tax-deductible contributions to
 a charitable sponsor. Donors give up legal control of these donated assets to the DAF sponsor, but retain advisory
 privileges that allow them to recommend how those funds are distributed to the nonprofits of their choosing and can
 also recommend how funds in the account are invested (The Foundation Review).
201 In the US, there is currently no spend-down requirement on these DAFs. A problem that could be addressed to
 increase the flow of funding to regeneration. (National Philanthropic Trust: 2023 DAF Report)

As the wave of return-seeking capital committing to investing in nature grows
(as explained in Section 1), we believe that the owners and managers of financial
capital will increasingly see the imperative to drive decentralization of financial
resource governance and catalyze the transition to a regenerative economy.

205 The World Bank has developed a ‚ÄòFeasibility-AmBitiousness (FAB) Matrix‚Äô for sovereign sustainability-linked bond
 criteria, which can be used to guide bioregional target setting.

BFFs provide a pathway for even multinational corporations ‚Äì that often seem to
operate everywhere and nowhere at the same time ‚Äì to come back into relationship
with the very real places and people they are dependent on and are in turn
impacting. BFFs enable them to move towards healing and reciprocity through how
they invest.

We have identified a range of return seeking funds under development that we
offer. More such funds are being launched all the time. Pollination and the Green
Climate Fund have recently launched a fund that aims to raise billions of dollars to
fund the transition of the agricultural system to regenerative practices. The fund
plans to finance smallholder farmers via local financial institutions ‚Äì a role that BFFs
are well suited to play.206 Additionally, there is potential for DAF investment (which
does not necessarily require a return), as well as DAF donations, to flow into BFFs.
We believe that it is important that capital holders build their capacity to understand
bioregional, systemic approaches to regeneration so that they are better equipped
to assess and engage with this new category of investment.

public direct investment can also play an important role in funding bioregional
regeneration. National and sub-national authorities have resources allocated
to various regeneration activities to support the provision of common assets. In
contrast to the public grant capital, outlined above, public direct investment often
involves projects of significant scale. Examples of projects where this form of capital
could be tapped include: dam removal and restoration, fire risk mitigation activities
on public lands, and coastal flood risk mitigation projects on public land.

Tax revenue and subsidies are important sources of funding, which can be raised
by sub-national or national authorities to support regenerative activities. BFFs
can work closely with these authorities to ensure alignment between economic
fiscal policy and Bioregional Regeneration Strategies.207 Taxes and subsidies will
play an important role in funding common assets. One possible structure for this is
the Common Asset Trust model. In this model, certain assets are held in common
and anyone who degrades them must pay in, where individuals or organizations
regenerating them receive compensation commensurate with their contributions.
Place-based taxation districts like utility districts, urban renewal districts,
municipalities, and counties provide precedents for both voluntary (e.g. Shuumi
Land Tax on Ohlone territory) and legislatively-authorized bioregional taxation.

Generally, we want to highlight that capitalization is needed both from outside
the bioregion and from within. While further dependencies on external financial
capital should be avoided, it will not be possible to mobilize the needed amounts
from within every bioregion ‚Äì particularly in colonized contexts that have been
subject to centuries of wealth extraction.208 At the same time, it is important that both
financial and real economic value flows remain rooted in the community, bringing
significant economic benefits through local circulation while also fostering a sense
of ownership and commitment among local stakeholders (more about the Local
Multiplier Effect in Section 4.5). In this way, external capital can be transitionary ‚Äì
helping to build endogenous capacity.

208 According to the UN International Panel on Climate Change: ‚ÄúVulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate
 change differs substantially among and within regions (very high confidence), driven by patterns of intersecting

 patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance (high confidence).‚Äù

Ultimately, mobilizing citizens and local businesses to become active investors, as
well as customers, clients, and advocates, should support a healthy local economy
that benefits both local and external stakeholders. Complementary currencies can
also play a key role here.209

4.4 Systemic Investment Portfolios for
 Bioregional Regeneration
sustainability and regeneration financing mechanisms. Even where individual
financing solutions are agreed upon today (e.g. a local bank issuing a loan on
concessionary terms to a social enterprise from the region), these merely focus
on a single project or intervention at a time, systematically disregarding the
interconnected nature of real life. From a systems perspective, catalyzing individual
projects in such an uncoordinated manner seldom has a meaningful impact on
overall transitions, and is unlikely to tip entire systems on relevant time scales. This
is one of the reasons why current approaches in impact investing and venture
philanthropy have not delivered the system-wide impact they promised to catalyze.
Often, individual project success is stalled by systemic barriers that could be
removed through policy change, market creation, or connectivity between different
silos of work.

recognizes the complexity inherent to systemic transformation and the fundamental
interconnectedness of interventions. We recommend that they build on the
emerging concept of systemic investing as an evolution of impact investing.210

investment portfolios that create cascading benefits, which enable mutually
reinforcing and positive feedback loops of systemic value generation across
projects. Projects bundled in a systemic portfolio (see Figure 10. below) enhance
each other's regenerative impact and financial performance alike. In addition to
viable business cases, investments in such synergistic and systemic portfolios
will likely include investments in a series of interventions with low or no direct
profitability that remove significant obstacles for other projects to become
successful in both impact and financial terms. These projects receive financing
because of their positive contribution to the overall success of the portfolio. For
example, simultaneously financing a set of farms to transition to regenerative
practices, an urban education program on healthy diets, and a sustainable
transportation system by bundling them in a systemic investment portfolio, helps the
projects succeed and strengthens the investment case. In this case, the education
program creates demand for healthy produce from regenerative farms, and a
sustainable supply chain benefits from increased transport volume from rural areas
to urban centers. At the same time, investors benefit from higher expected overall
profitability as projects mutually enhance their value proposition.

The current investment paradigm, built on Modern Portfolio Theory, aims to
minimize correlation between assets and to maximize diversification to reduce
investment risk. This is based on the myth that investors cannot impact systemic
risks through their capital allocation decisions.211 This assumption is becoming
increasingly hard to justify in the age of the polycrisis and as assessments of how
investment portfolios are contributing to specific risks increase in their robustness
and specificity.

In contrast, bioregional investment portfolios intentionally seek to create a
harmonious interplay among diverse assets, leveraging spillover effects and
fostering mutual reinforcement. By setting the investment strategy to meticulously
select and align assets that complement one another, the portfolio generates
synergistic effects across the bioregional economy. This mimics how resource
flows are structured in living systems, and allows the combined regenerative impact
to far exceed the sum of its individual components.

How this works on a bioregional transition or bioregional economy level can be
compared to how Venture Capital and Private Equity investments, for example,
do not only invest in the production and sales teams of a given company but also
recognize the indirect contribution of, for example, the accounting and human
resources departments as necessary overheads that require resourcing. At the
bioregional scale, such ‚Äúoverheads‚Äù might include activism and policy work,
systems mapping, multi-stakeholder convening and facilitation work, conflict
mediation, and the services provided by Bioregional Hubs more broadly (see
Section 3.2).

Through such an ecosystem-based investment approach at the bioregional scale,
individual interventions add up to meaningful, directional, and catalyzed transitions.
Even innovation gaps can be clearly identified, labeled, and signaled to the public to
spur new project development and business creation.

211 In their 2023 book Moving Beyond Modern Portfolio Theory: Investing That Matters, Lukomnik and Hawley debunk this
 myth.

While traditionally, investors or other financial intermediaries would pick projects
for their portfolios, new governance mechanisms in the BFFs could ensure that
bioregional investment portfolios are built through decentralized decision-making
and in alignment with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy.

Bioregional investment portfolios can either cover a series of place-based assets
across regeneration themes, or a range of thematic assets across various
geographies (see image below). This allows both investors with place-based
intentions or restrictions and investors with thematically restricted investment foci
to participate in bioregional regeneration finance. Investing in different types of
portfolios can also help with diversification and investment risk mitigation.

portfolios.

4.5 Shifting theories of value and ownership
As shown above, BFFs serve the realization of the Bioregional Regeneration
Strategy. Their task is to determine how financial resources can best be deployed
to support the transition to regenerative economies. This purpose, embedded in
the BFF structure, enables them to support a shift in theory of value in the bioregion.
Over time, BFFs can also enable a shift in value for the external actors the bioregion
engages with. In The Value of Everything, Mariana Mazzucato directs us to look at
who defines value, creates value, and reaps the rewards of that value.212 BFFs can
enable value ‚Äì identified through participatory processes including participatory
budgeting ‚Äì to translate into the bioregional economy, its neighboring economies,
and the global economy. Additionally, BFFs support the transition to a more local

212 Mazzucato: The Value of Everything

economy ‚Äì enabling a greater percentage of the value created by the people
there to stay there. The ‚ÄúLocal Multiplier Effect‚Äù213 shows that money spent in the
local economy circulates more often in that place than money spent at non-local
businesses (AIBA). Moving from an individual to a shared ownership model, or even
self-sovereignty of living systems, can support a paradigm-level shift to catalyze the
transition to regenerative economies.

The concepts of property and ownership often imply notions of dominion and
control, leading us to view elements of the natural world, such as animals, land,
and minerals, as commodities.214 In regenerative economies, timber is not worth
more than an intact forest and a whale‚Äôs life is not interchangeable with 23,500
barrels of oil.215 There is value in their respective existence separate from the value
they provide to humans. BFFs can support the repair of relationships between
humans and the rest of life in a way that recognizes the intrinsic value of the
more-than-human world. Enabling the legibility of this value is something that
other financial instruments and institutions have largely failed to do thus far. The
monoculturization216 of value has been reinforced by abstract, decontextualized
economic metrics including GDP that take a uniform approach to assessing value.
It has also been bolstered by new markets like decentralized finance, with metrics
such as ‚ÄúTotal Value Locked‚Äù that fall into the trap of Goodhart‚Äôs law, where the
measure becomes the target. This collapses dimensionality, as such measures
fail to account for real value creation or ecological well being, and do not account
for much needed circulation in our value flows.217 There are promising models
like Bhutan‚Äôs Gross Domestic Happiness (GDH) and metrics oriented towards
dynamism and circulation like Total Value Flowed that BFFs can iterate on and
contextualize bioregionally.

Pilots of mechanisms through which BFFs can support the legibility of varying
dimensions of value ‚Äì including giving mountains and rivers their own blockchain
addresses and wallets ‚Äì are underway (see more in the Regen Network case
study). Indigenous ways of relating to the more-than-human world, particularly
through a kinship lens, are beginning to spread. Additionally, shifting technological
capacities can support this legibility, as laid out in Gaia 2.0. Finally, the development
of complementary or Nature-based Currencies can play a critical role in shifting the
local economy to align with what people in a bioregion value.

 and Money.

 5. BFF
 Governance
 and Capital
 Allocation
The governance structure of BFFs underpins their ability to decentralize financial
resource governance, organize synergistic portfolios, and catalyze the transition
to a regenerative economy. In this section, we offer high-level guidance regarding
several key considerations and aims for governance, and offer various approaches
and tools that we hope will be helpful. However, a full exploration of governance is
not within the scope of this book.
At their core, financial institutions ‚ÄìBFFs and otherwise ‚Äì are humans coming
together to make decisions about how to raise and allocate resources and build
systems to execute those decisions. In other words, they are ultimately about
governance, and governance is challenging for all types of organizations. Adding
further difficulty, BFFs represent an intentional attempt to encode an institution with
worldviews, values, logic, and context that are fundamentally distinct from those of
existing financial institutions. The beliefs, assumptions, and habits of governance
resulting from education, socialization, and participation in modern institutions
can be expected to cause friction where attempts are made to govern resource
raising and allocation towards genuine regeneration, free from externalities. While
humbled by the magnitude of this challenge, we also believe that the ancient and
modern wisdom needed to support this purpose is alive and accessible. Through
experiments in creating BFFs around the world, the collective intelligence of place
can be harnessed to inform and support an entire network of BFFs ‚Äì allowing
common patterns of trustworthy governance structures to emerge.

5.1 Key consideration: What are the values?
The governance structure (frameworks, processes, and participants) is what
encodes values held by individuals or a group into an institution. BFF attribute
#3 (Section 4.1) offers the highest level guidance: ‚ÄúImplement an inclusive,
participatory governance structure that represents the bioregion.‚Äù While inclusivity,
participation, and representation are values that can be understood very broadly,
each Bioregional Regeneration Strategy should work to clarify specific, place-based
understandings of these and other values that are to be upheld in any aspect of the
work, especially BFF governance. We recommend that the ‚ÄúR Values‚Äù that many
Indigenous communities center in their governance (Section 4.1) also play a key

role in governance design.218 In particular, we highlight that given the complexity
and delicacy of governance, BFFs can only succeed if built on a solid relational
foundation that creates a culture of trust.

5.2 Key consideration: Who participates?
The Bioregional Organizing Team will organize and activate key bioregional actors,
and identify appropriate bioregional representatives to serve in BFF governance.
There are pros and cons in taking a more democratic approach, so BFFs may
want to consider an approach of progressive decentralization, where a Bioregional
Organizing Team might decide to pursue something more open after a given BFF
has a solid foundation. A participatory process to identify trusted actors in the
ecosystem (including through leveraging Web3 technologies) can play a role.
To sincerely ‚Äúrepresent the bioregion‚Äù, the management, board, investment
committee, and participatory processes that feed into the capital allocation should
be representative of the people living and working in the bioregion, and the people
that have historically stewarded land in the bioregion (if they have been misplaced).
We strongly recommend that the board be ethnically and culturally representative
of bioregional residents and, particularly, that Indigenous groups are represented
in the places where they reside.219 This is important, as Indigenous representatives
will bring wisdom from centuries of regenerative land stewardship, relational
worldviews focused on kinship, and life-centered theories of value. Additionally, a
process should be established to receive regular input from both youth and elders.
Additional processes might be established to ensure other underrepresented
groups have a voice ‚Äì including low-income, previously incarcerated, otherly-
abled, LGBTQIA+ people, ethnic minorities, refugees, and others. This diversity will
be beneficial for cultivating the collective intelligence needed to effectively drive
financial capital to regeneration. We strongly recommend that governance boards
rotate periodically in order to bring new energy and ideas to BFFs. For the board in
particular, a town hall or election could be held to select members.
We also recommend the inclusion of representatives for more-than-human life
on BFF boards to ensure that the financial capital raised is not used to narrowly
serve human interests, but is allocated to serve all of the life in the bioregion. There
is a growing body of work around rights of nature and how nature can be given
jurisdictional rights. Species and geological or hydrological features (e.g. rivers and
mountains) are also being placed on boards through human proxies and even own
assets (more about this in the case study on Regen Network).220
Technical expertise and relationships with key stakeholders will also be important
enablers for effective BFF governance. BFF management teams must be bridge
builders ‚Äì understanding economics, finance, systems change, as well as having
a connection to local context, risks, and opportunities. Team members are likely Transcontextual ‚Äì The

management. The BFF management team should be adept at using software
tools ‚Äì including the latest nature MRV, community engagement, and participatory
budgeting software. Governance representatives should also be long-term thinkers,
as they will be making investment decisions that should align with a 20-100+ year or
multigenerational Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Selecting the right people for
these positions is critical in ensuring that BFFs can effectively serve as connective
tissue.
Another consideration for BFF governance is the interplay between public and
expert forums. Public forums should be a place for free expression and, therefore,
not dominated by experts, while expert forums222 should provide latitude for experts
to exchange specialized knowledge without having to conform to popular opinion
or to cultivate a following. BFF governance processes should support this balance,
and the integration of voices from both the public and experts can help ensure that
decisions are data-driven, account for stakeholder needs, and are democratically
legitimate.223

5.3 Key consideration: What frameworks,
 processes, and tools?
A wide range of frameworks can be applied to support the implementation of an
‚Äúinclusive, participatory governance structure that represents the bioregion.‚Äù We
offer no prescriptions here, besides strongly recommending study of place-based
Indigenous governance frameworks and commons management frameworks ‚Äì
including Elinor Ostrom‚Äôs 8 Principles for Managing a Commons. However, several
frameworks that may be useful in establishing a governance structure include:
‚Äî Prosocial, a scientific framework (built upon Ostrom‚Äôs foundational research)
 and guided process for designing governance structures that support
 cooperative behavior
‚Äî Sociocracy and Holacracy, two similar systems that support self-governance
 and decentralization224
‚Äî Traditional hierarchical structures with checks & balances (e.g. wisdom/elder
 councils, purpose guardians/trustees)
Regarding processes, each BFF will need systems in place to enable transparency
and responsiveness around capital raising and allocation. To the extent possible,
BFFs should seek to make documents about these processeses public. Decision
criteria about which projects are selected and why should be published. Tools such
as Open Collective, ‚Äúa fundraising + legal status + money management platform for
grassroots groups,‚Äù can support these efforts in their early stages. The affiliations of
the board, investment committee, and management of BFFs should be disclosed,
so conflicts of interest can be identified and addressed as appropriate. Additionally,
BFFs should be responsive to the requests and recommendations of the public.
BFFs should enable empowered participation ‚Äì recognizing that all citizens of

224 ‚ÄúHolacracy is one form of sociocracy. While sociocracy leaves a lot of room for many parameters to be set by the
 individual organization, Holacracy comes with a lot of pre-set parameters.‚Äù (Sociocracy For All: Sociocracy and
 Holacracy: Sameness and differences).

the bioregion have a right to shape the decisions about the future of their place.
For example, citizens assembled might play an important role early in the BFF
strategy process. Later on, BFFs might host town hall meetings at regular intervals
in order to hear about urgent investment needs directly from community members
before making grant or investment decisions or to get feedback on the impact of
investments.
Innovative social methodologies and tools for collective decision-making that may
support the design and execution of broader governance structures include:
‚Äî Liquid Democracy, ‚Äúa form of delegative democracy, whereby an electorate
 engages in collective decision-making through direct participation and dynamic
 representation.‚Äù225 The non-profit Liquid Democracy provides open-source tools
 to support such processes.
‚Äî Participatory budgeting through an Edge Prize-inspired model
‚Äî Emerging tech that allows for real-time preference signaling (such as Quadratic
 Voting and Conviction Voting).
‚Äî Novel voting delegation mechanisms (e.g. Neural Quorum Governance).226
‚Äî ‚ÄúTwo Eyed Seeing‚Äù ‚Äì a concept from the Acadia and Eskasoni Nations

‚Äî Systems for sourcing and privileging contextual data based on social
 relationships of trust. For example, the opinions of trusted subject-matter
 experts and place-based representatives can be highlighted in the discussion of
 issues, which may support finding common ground and weighing of trade-offs. If
 using a voting system, their votes could carry more weight.228
‚Äî Polis, ‚Äúa real-time system for gathering, analyzing and understanding what large

‚Äî RadicalxChange, a platform that provides tools that support participatory and
 pluralistic funding, voting and ownership structures.
‚Äî Convergent Facilitation, ‚Äúa decision-making process designed to build trust
 across differences and integrate what's important to everyone involved.‚Äù

5.4 Key aim: Work to shift power imbalances
Shifting power imbalances requires BFF management and board members to see,
understand, and commit to addressing these imbalances among themselves, with
citizens in the bioregion, and between financial capital holders and regenerators.
To do this, they must embrace this work as a collective learning and unlearning ‚Äì
recognizing how their worldview and life experience have shaped them. For those
holding substantial financial capital or financial and legal expertise, their ways of
thinking, communicating, and acting, both consciously and unconsciously, are likely

 Weyl, and Buterin: Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul)

to have been crafted in part by learning how to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in navigating dominant
systems of power. These learned traits may present challenges in a diverse group
orienting around alternative value systems, especially in conversations of money
and governance. Thus, it is critical that BFFs intentionally work to foster a healthy
learning culture with a shared commitment to engaging in discussions about
shifting power imbalances openly, humbly, and with care. Employing professional
facilitators and educators, along with broader engagement with the BioFi
Community of Practice (see attribute #12 in Section 4.1), can help establish and
maintain this culture.

BFFs can also take steps to structure governance to prevent incentives that might
put profits over purpose and compromise the BFF‚Äôs ability to serve the Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy. For example, operating governance can be separated from
governance of the distribution of profits, so that those overseeing operations are not
tempted to drive profits over purpose.

5.5 Key aim: Work with existing authorities
BFFs and Bioregional Organizing Teams can partner and support existing public
work that is aligned with the Bioregional Regeneration Strategy and receives
aligned public funding to educate and advocate to local authorities in areas where
they see gaps in public programs; mobilize resources for critical activities when Partner state ‚Äì Multi-
local authorities are failing to do so; and act as a ‚Äòpartner state‚Äô over time.229 stakeholder cooperatives
While bioregional governance, capacity building resources, and financing facilities or commons-based
are under development, national and sub-national authorities continue to hold institutions responsible for the
 management and provision of
the majority of these resources and management responsibilities. Therefore,
 certain public goods, common
knowledge of public programs and procedures can support BFF management assets, or services that were
and boards in effectively raising and allocating financial capital or other resources once the responsibility of

strategies for devolving decision making around resource allocation to bioregional
entities. This has been done with watershed authorities in many places globally,
including Washington and Oregon in the US, New Zealand, and Australia. Similarly,
Costa Rica has Territorial Councils.

5.6 Key aim: Build right relationship with
 other BFFs across regions and scales
Bioregionalism is about appropriate alignment with the natural systems and
cultures of a region. The understanding that bioregions are interdependent with
each other and contain within them many scales of natural systems and cultures
is fundamental to achieving appropriate alignment. For example, rivers often cross
multiple bioregions that each have fractal watersheds and distinct cultural regions,
all of which are interdependent with the river. Appropriately allocating financial

resources to support the regeneration of the river and its interdependent regions
simply cannot be done by a single institution. For BFFs to effectively fulfill the vision
of planetary regeneration, they must be able to govern in right relationship with each
other. In some cases BFFs may form relationships of solidarity, deciding to share
resources ‚Äî and their governance ‚Äî towards interdependent aims. In other cases,
BFFs may identify the need to invest in the creation of additional BFFs at higher or
lower scales so that resources can be governed and distributed fractally. These are
only two possibilities; there is no theoretically ideal prescription that can be offered
today for what these right relationships should be, as it will depend entirely upon
the emergent capacity in each area. At this early stage, however, it is critical that
BFFs are designed with this fundamental entanglement in mind, and that they seek
to build relationships of trust with other relevant BFFs and emerging Bioregional
Hubs, such that healthy conditions for gradual experimentation towards shared,
interoperable governance in right relationship are established.

There are a range of innovative financing mechanisms that we believe can help
BFFs achieve their objectives. Many of the themes explored in this book are aligned
with the values and patterns driving the decentralized finance or ‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù movement.
The authors believe that the potential of existing protocols, tools, technologies, and
templates in the Web3 space to bolster the bioregional movement and supercharge
grassroots regeneration, has ‚Äì as yet ‚Äì not been realized. Additionally, there is
potential for further innovation, building on what has been learned in Web3 to date
and what we have laid out with the objectives, attributes, and templates of BFFs.
The BioFi x DeFi intersection provides fertile soil for experimentation. In this section,
we explore a range of innovative financial tools and approaches (in the DeFi space
enable participatory capital allocation, and support the transition to regenerative
bioregional economies. Some areas we would like to see further innovation and
experimentation include: bioregional Nature-based Currencies, bioregional
participatory capital allocation (including through Quadratic Voting or Quadratic
Funding), and the construction of Ecological Institutions for ecosystems or species
to support their regeneration and sovereignty.

6.1 Web3-based eco-credits, Decentralized
 Autonomous Organizations, and Ecological
 Institutions
Web3-based eco-credits, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs),
and Ecological Institutions present innovative tools for financing bioregional
regeneration efforts. Web3-based eco-credits, built on blockchain or Holochain231

231 While similar to blockchain in using cryptography to create a distributed ledger for decentralized data management,
 Holochain is designed to empower peer-to-peer coordination and agreement customization while yielding greater
 efficiency and scalability by avoiding blockchain‚Äôs dependence on a single universal system state across all
 participating computers. (HOLO: Here‚Äôs Holochain in 100, 200, and 500 words)

platforms, provide a transparent and traceable mechanism for validating ecological
health. They can measure and trace such indicators as carbon sequestration,
biodiversity indices, erosion mitigation, water conservation, social prosperity and
wellbeing, and cultural integrity indicators like Indigenous ancestral stewardship.
(see case study on Regen Network below). These eco-credits can be tokenized and
traded on decentralized marketplaces, allowing stakeholders to invest in bioregional
regeneration initiatives. It is important to recognize that these eco-credits are not
primarily designed to ‚Äúoffset‚Äù destructive activities, as in the case of conventional
carbon credits. They can play a much more flexible role in recording the
community-determined value of a set of regenerative actions, and they can identify
the value flows of biodiversity and ecosystem services in need of preservation or
regeneration and validate effective action taken. Eco-credits can support the shift
to more pluralistic approaches to assessing value within a bioregion. This enables a
more transparent view of financial beneficiaries so buyers can make more informed
choices that align with economies rooted in equity and commons stewardship.

The joint ownership and authorship of eco-credits is made possible through
decentralized protocols in the form of blockchain-powered DAOs. DAOs can
be understood as an evolution of commons, combining digital governance with
common pool resource management. They enable decentralized decision-
making and resource allocation within a community, leveraging smart contracts,
to automate the distribution of funds for bioregional regeneration projects based
on predefined criteria and community consensus. Through DAOs and Web3-
based eco-credits, communities can mobilize financial resources in a transparent,
accountable, and decentralized manner. Examples of DAOs innovating to support
regeneration include Gitcoin, Kolektivo, and Big Green DAO.

Ecological Institutions use decentralized protocols to enable the creation of
novel legal and economic actors, which would not be possible in a conventional
centralized system of ownership, sensing, and governance. These Institutions
enable non-conventional ecological actors, like non-human organisms,
ecosystems, and even whole bioregions, to own their own currency, deeds, and
information held on their unique blockchain address (See more in the Regen
Network case study below).232

 CASE STUDY 6:
 Regen Network and Eco-Credits - A Novel Funding
 Mechanism for Regeneration
 By: Austin Wade Smith

 About the Regen Network
 Established on the belief that land stewards and local communities should define
 what eco-social regeneration looks like in their context, the Regen Network is an
 open source technology stack and blockchain dedicated to the redefinition of value,
 away from extraction, towards planetary regeneration. At the core of the project, is
 the belief that the instruments used to align finance with environmental wellbeing

232 Regen Foundation: Ecological Institutions ‚Üí Protocols to Grow Autonomous and Convivial Ecological Actors

 must be owned and governed by communities practicing regeneration. One of the
 primary instruments in achieving this are eco-credits, a novel funding mechanism
 that can support the protection of ecosystems and the stewardship practices which
 regenerate them. An eco-credit can be understood as an evolution of ecosystem
 service credits used in climate finance, like carbon credits, with several critical
 differences. Credits function like a discrete unit of value ‚Äì fungible, non-fungible, or a
 combination of both ‚Äì within a regenerative economic paradigm. Unlike philanthropy
 or impact investing, which allocate resources to critical habitats and people who need
 it most, regenerative economics redefines value at its root, arguing that ecosystems
 and their steward relationships produce value while alive and intact through their life-
 sustaining ecosystem functions, not just as commodities and raw materials.

 Attesting to data is a way to validate a piece of data and is comparable to signing a
 legal document ‚Äì implying the contents of the data are accepted to be true by the
 attestor to the best of their knowledge.
 Governance
 The dynamic composition of eco-credits reflects the belief that regeneration looks
 like different measures, indices, and practices in different places. Eco-credits are
 reflections of their biocultural context. Rather than top-down prescriptions of what
 regeneration looks like across different contexts endemic to climate finance, the
 composition of eco-credits must reflect the people, bioregion, and a larger story of
 place. The definition and creation of an eco-credit is coauthored by the larger group of
 stakeholders through governance processes:
 ‚Äî The primary author of the terms and composition of an eco-credit is the
 bioregional community directly responsible for the stewardship.
 ‚Äî Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs), ecosystem guardians and
 protectors must hold the primary authority for what biocultural indicators mark the
 composition of a credit.
 ‚Äî This bottom up definition of value is corroborated with external stakeholders, like
 the scientific community, as well credit purchasers.
 A process of co-authorship for the definition of value beginning with stewards

 themselves means the identity and wellbeing of the communities doing the direct
 work of restoring and protecting ecosystems are centered in the design and
 development of eco-credits.
 Definition through decentralized protocols
 The joint ownership and authorship of eco-credits is made possible through
 decentralized protocols in the form of DAOs. DAOs can be understood as an evolution
 of commons, wedding digital governance with common pool resource management.
 They are a hybrid of digital knowledge commons and biospheric commons. DAOs can
 be bioregionally defined; in bioregional DAOs, the members who govern the DAO are
 bound by a particular region and may include the grassroots communities directly
 responsible for the regenerative work like IPLC‚Äôs, local stewards, community boards,
 and guardians. DAOs may also be defined by association as guild DAOs, where
 members who govern the DAO are affiliated by shared knowledge and expertise ‚Äì
 like scientific peer communities, supply chains, and impact verifiers. Designing the
 governance model between bioregional and guild DAOs allows different stakeholders
 to interact in a facilitated manner to govern the composition, roles, and terms of
 eco-credits. This is particularly important for the co-authoring of credits between
 originators and purchasers. It also allows all aspects of the creation of eco-credits to
 be transparent as appropriate, auditable, and thus continuously accountable to the
 claims and attestations they define.
 Ecological Institutions
 Additionally, the use of decentralized protocols enables the creation of novel legal
 and economic actors, which would not be possible in a conventional centralized
 system of ownership, sensing, and governance. Decentralized protocols enable non-
 conventional ecological actors, like non-human organisms, ecosystems, and even
 whole bioregions to own their own currency, deeds, and information. Ecosystems
 are in effect autonomous funds or trusts of information and currency that disperse
 resources towards different stakeholders or initiatives based on the satisfaction of
 contractual conditions. These entities, broadly referred to as Ecological Institutions,
 are an integration of regenerative economics enabled by blockchains and DAOs
 with the rights of nature movement, proposed by the emerging field of Earth law.
 Legal personhood and other designations allow organisms, ecosystems, and whole
 bioregions to own their own currency, data, and contracts in digital form. This means
 non-humans are able to legally possess digital currencies, digital files, and data
 sets, as well as digital copies of contracts and deeds. The design and definition of
 Ecological Institutions is an area for significant potential research, which integrates
 social governance practices with data inputs in the form of oracles. Oracles can
 be understood as ecological sensing systems which deliver data about the state of
 ecosystems and organisms as inputs into software systems, controlling the behavior
 of algorithms based on conditions in the environment. Ecological Institutions may
 issue, own, or coordinate the creation and circulation of eco-credits using a stack like
 the Regen Network. A comprehensive introduction to this topic can be found in the
 paper, Ecological Institutions by Austin Wade Smith, Regen Foundation, and Earth Law
 Center.
 Programmable circulation
 The relationship between eco-credits and decentralized protocols allows finer control
 over the terms and conditions of credit sales. Originators of eco-credits are able to
 specify to whom credits can or cannot be sold, as well as the terms of their fungibility
 or expiration. This allows the nature of the credit circulation to be programmable

 by the originators. We broadly refer to the ability to control how credits are sold, to
 whom, and the terms of their resale as programmable circulation, because unlike
 conventional financial systems, eco-credits issued and exchanged on blockchains,
 allow originators of credits to specify the conditions of how eco-credits are
 transacted.
 While enabled by decentralized protocols of ownership and governance,
 decentralized protocols are not required. The principle of community ownership
 around the terms and definition of regeneration at a local level lies at the heart of what
 an eco-credit is. As such, they may be implemented across a wide range of systems,
 which do not run on top of decentralized ledger technologies like blockchains.
 Regen Network works to scale joint trust agreements between originators and
 purchasers around context-specific regenerative action in the form of high integrity
 eco-credits. The Network supports an international community of practitioners and
 project developers designing and issuing eco-credits through the Regen Network
 app. Monthly eco-credit Builder Labs support and catalyze credit development, and
 are a good entry point into learning more about the relation of eco-credits to BFFs.

6.2 (Digital) Nature-based Currencies
Bioregional Banks could issue complementary Nature-based Currencies that
base their value on the health and vitality of the local ecosystems - the ecological
wealth - in a given bioregion. While most currencies in circulation today are no
longer linked to physical assets such as gold, these new currencies would be tied
to natural assets ‚Äì fostering a symbiotic relationship between local economies and
ecosystems. With this form of bioregional, asset-backed currency, BFFs could issue
tokens representing natural assets like clean water, wild animal populations, or
biodiversity conservation ‚Äì incentivizing regenerative practices and the responsible
stewardship of natural assets. Nature-based Currencies could also be backed by
a basket of bioregional eco-credits. Ongoing research on the application of active
inference233 in the design of Nature-based Currencies can inform prototypes by
bioregions. By integrating ecological indicators of health into monetary systems,
BFFs can enable a shift in theory of value within the bioregion and beyond. For more
information on digital Nature-based Currencies, we recommend reading Nature
Based Currencies: Integrating natural capital in advanced monetary systems, a
white paper by Open Earth Foundation.234

6.3 Local Market Networks and Bioregional
 Vouchers
While not necessarily a novel solution, Local Market Networks are potentially
powerful ways to resource bioregional transitions toward regenerative economies.

 Kolektivo: Primer on Natural Capital Currencies;
 Silvi: TreeForwards;
 Ernesto van Peborgh: Living Capital Design: The Rise of Nature-based Currencies;
 Single.Earth: World‚Äôs First Nature-Backed Currency MERIT

These networks are decentralized systems connecting producers, consumers,
and investors within a bioregion. Emphasizing local sourcing, production, and
consumption, the networks can take various forms, including farmers' markets,
Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs, online platforms for local goods,
and community-based cooperatives. Local Market Networks aim to strengthen
local economies, reduce environmental impact by minimizing transportation and
supporting regenerative practices, and foster community resilience by promoting
relationships between producers and consumers locally. They often prioritize
transparency, ethical sourcing, and community engagement over traditional market
dynamics such as competition.

Local Market Networks can also include innovative approaches like Bioregional
Community Voucher systems as a form of community currency.235 These systems
promote local economic resilience by circulating currency within the community,
facilitating transactions between residents and with local businesses. Unlike
conventional currency, these vouchers are tied to a specific bioregion, encouraging
value exchange within the bioregional economy and supporting bioregional
regeneration efforts. Such community currencies enable the two essential functions
of money (i.e. serving as a standard of value and facilitating exchange), promoting
quick circulation and discouraging its utilization as a store of value or a medium
for speculation. They foster a sense of community ownership and solidarity,
empowering residents to actively participate in shaping the future of their bioregion.
They can also be used to avoid the undesired financialisation of value flows.

6.4 Bioservices Banks
A Bioservices Bank236 is designed to integrate ecological services into the local
financial system by turning them into financial assets. By issuing bills of exchange
pegged against a stable currency and underwritten by third parties, the bank
monetizes ecological services, creating a self-sustaining engine for financing
ecological action. A Bioservices Bank operates by issuing notes equivalent to a
national currency, backed by the value of ecological services. These notes become
liquid in the market once the underwritten ecological services are matched with
liabilities or financed through various methods. This system effectively transforms
environmental conservation into a bankable service, creating a perpetual financing
mechanism.
A pivotal element of this concept is the integration of a system where landowners
and other actors can attribute their future rights to ecological services ‚Äî for
example the carbon sequestration rights of their land to the bank. This process,
functioning similarly to assigning rights, allows these stakeholders to contribute
their future ecological assets to the bank. In exchange for this contribution, they
receive equity in the Bioservices Bank. This mechanism ensures that stakeholders
directly benefit from the bank's capitalization and investments made by the bank
or other agents in ecological projects. Thus, it creates a mutually beneficial
relationship, aligning the interests of individual landowners and other actors with the
broader goals of transitioning to regenerative bioregional economies.

A key feature of the proposed bank is its reliance on automation and transparent
governance. The verification of ecological services, transaction processes,
and banking operations would be fully automated, utilizing digital sensors and

transparent frameworks. This ensures efficiency, accountability, and public trust.
The governance structure is designed to avoid conflicts of interest. It suggests
an independent oversight mechanism, separate from the banking institution‚Äôs
administrative body. This is crucial for maintaining impartiality and enhancing
credibility.

 propose and vote on ideas. The Wellbeing Protocol team, a not-for-profit organization
 building technology-based infrastructure, was asked to set up a trial and developed
 an app that bioregional stakeholders could use for proposals and the voting process.
 To positively constrain the types of projects which could be approved, the strategic
 vision was adapted into a constitution; all of the projects proposed and approved
 needed to fit with the constitution and vision. Once initial funding was secured from
 the local Tasman District Council, a kickoff meeting for Mohua Wellbeing 2042 was
 organized.
 Launching the Trust
 During the kickoff, community members learned both how the app functioned, and
 shared the projects they believed were valuable in advancing the goals set out in the
 strategic vision document and constitution. They also learned about other potential
 local projects, and the members who were present voted on projects using the app.
 The Wellbeing Protocol team demonstrated that projects which receive a certain
 number of up-votes would be approved to move to the next stage through Quadratic
 Voting. By this method, rather than using 10 percent of their tokens to give one up-
 vote, a member could use 40 percent of their tokens for two up-votes or 90 percent of
 their tokens for three up-votes. This allowed community members to cast their votes
 according to how passionate they were about a project. The up-votes would also be
 buffered using the Conviction Voting approach, such that the full power of the vote
 only set in after the vote was not moved or changed to another option.
 Once a project receives enough up-votes from the community, the bioregional
 trustees ‚Äì who are stewards within the app ‚Äì can choose to move the project to
 the next phase but this is only possible if the project matches with the constitution,
 which is viewable by anyone within the app. Prior to moving the project to the next
 phase it is also reviewed in terms of its budget and feasibility, and stewards can make
 suggestions for changes to the project proposers during this time. The projects that
 make it to the final phase are then voted on again by the community. The amount of
 funding the project requires compared to the amount of money in the community
 funding pool determines the up-vote threshold the project must meet to be approved.
 Moving to implementation
 As of March 2024, four projects have progressed to the final proposal phase. Once a
 project is approved, the stewards work with the project lead to transfer the approved
 funding amount. As the project evolves, photos and videos related to the progress
 of the project are uploaded to the app for anyone in the community to view. In the
 first phase of funding, individual project costs ranged from NZD 200 to 1,000. The

239 Mohua 2042: Strategy Document

 next phase involves securing ongoing funding to top up this community funding pool,
 ideally by local government and local companies. Initial funding was sourced by the
 local government and a few leads have been established with companies that have
 verbally committed to allocating 10 percent of their profits to community projects that
 support bioregional wellbeing. One advantage of the rolling approach is that capital
 can be added as trust is built that the community can collectively propose, steward,
 and execute on valuable projects.
 The plan is also to help steward community-benefit companies that are steward-
 owned, i.e. owned by their purpose. These companies would be required to tithe
 10 percent of their profits to Mohua Wellbeing, and would receive help with their
 incubation from local community business advisors as well as receiving community or
 purpose oversight from the Mohua 2042 Bioregional Trust. Mohua 2042 is a charitable
 non-profit, and the trust deed allows trustees to serve in an oversight capacity for
 purpose-owned companies in an unpaid capacity.

6.6 Quadratic Funding and Equity Crowdfunding
as proxies for capital allocation
Crowdfunding is a financing instrument that allows ordinary citizens to participate
in funding projects that are subjectively important to them. In the special case of
equity crowd-funding, participating individuals gain shares of the funded project or
business in return for their money. Place-based Equity Crowdfunding thus allows
local stakeholders to participate in the success of the local regenerative economy,
and simultaneously weaves even stronger connections in this local economy. At
the same time, aggregated data from such place-based crowdfunding platforms
could help funders and investors who are not as immersed in the local context
to understand which projects locals consider worthy and promising. This helps
them to overcome knowledge gaps, and investment decisions can be made
more in alignment with what local people think best contributes to the Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy. This approach operates on the premise that locals know
best what is required for holistic regeneration, and where the likelihood of financial Quadratic Funding ‚Äì By
success is highest. This way, more money can find its way to the right regeneration allocating funds based on
projects in a bioregion. By surfacing tacit grassroots knowledge, place-based Equity a quadratic formula that

Quadratic Voting, incentivizes collaboration and fosters a sense of collective
ownership, ensuring that resources are allocated to projects with broad-based
support and high potential for long-term regenerative impact. Since 2019, Quadratic
Funding pioneer Gitcoin DAO has channeled over $60 million from 4.2 million
unique donations to fund open-source Web3 digital infrastructure and social and
ecological impact projects, including $3.9 million towards ‚Äúclimate solutions.‚Äù An
example of a funder leveraging Gitcoin for regeneration, is Ma Earth‚Äôs recent 2024
grant round, which supported regenerative land projects.

6.7 Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)
Another model for funding regenerative projects is the Retroactive Public Goods
Funding (RetroPGF) approach developed by the Optimism Collective. This model
is based on the idea that it is easier to agree on what was useful in the past than
what might be useful in the future. The approach aims to enable distributed but not
fully decentralized capital allocation to public goods242 projects (similar to Quadratic
Voting and Quadratic Funding). In the case of RetroPGF - which is initially focused
on funding software development - badge holders vote on projects and funding
is allocated based on the median score projects receive. Through this approach,
the community can select criteria for people with specialized expertise. These
specialists then do the necessary research and analysis to determine which
projects created the greatest community benefits. The RetroPGF structure provides
possible exit liquidity for public goods projects, which opens up a market for early
investment in those projects. In the case of RetroPGF, revenue from the use of open
source software funds that work retroactively. This approach to the governance
of capital allocation could support regenerative projects ‚Äì particularly in areas like
ecological regeneration that also require a sufficient level of technical expertise,
whether Western or Indigenous, and where revenue is hard to capture directly at
the project level. One of the major challenges with this approach is that it requires
projects to have access to seed funding at the outset. Thus, it will likely not work well
in low-income communities.

6.8 Web3 flow funding and dynamic token
 issuance mechanisms for living, adaptive
 economies
Traditional grant models and discrete funding can put the focus on securing
operational funding, reducing the amount of time organizations spend on
performing mission-related work. For regenerative economies to flourish,
resource allocation must more closely resemble the living systems they aim to
mirror in information and economic systems. Flow funding has been identified as
an innovative mechanism for this purpose, and with blockchain and novel digital
currency issuance mechanisms, funding flows can be automated, integrated, and
expressed as highly adaptive economies that can contract and expand based on
needs and value creation in the network.

242 In this book, we primarily refer to public goods as ‚Äòcommon assets.‚Äô

One such mechanism making use of flow funding ‚Äì bonding curves ‚Äì holds
great potential for the implementation of BFFs. Bonding curves243 are a new tool
in the Web3 space that tie two or more elements of a system together through
mathematical relationships encoded into smart contracts. They provide an
economic invariant between the supply of tokens and the reserve assets backing
their value, making token price deterministic and providing guaranteed liquidity for
tokens. Adjusting the circulating supply based on demand dampens the volatility
and couples with the demand for the token‚Äôs utility. Bonding curves and primary
market token issuance lay the economic foundations for new tools that can
address some of the major challenges of distributed economic systems, such as
bootstrapping small economies, providing necessary exchange liquidity, facilitating
demand-responsive dynamic token supply, and continuous fundraising. Bonding
curves have also been ‚Äòaugmented‚Äô with the addition of common pool treasuries or
even prediction markets, to improve the collective signaling capacity of these new
tools for social and ecosystemic benefit.

6.9 Place-based Bioregional Tithing, voluntary
 taxation, and Business Improvement Districts
Bioregional Tithing, voluntary taxation, or taxation-like initiatives, such as Business
Improvement Districts (BIDs) offer a promising avenue for financing bioregional
regeneration. BIDs provide a defined area within which businesses elect to pay an
additional fee in order to fund projects within the district's boundaries. By harnessing
the collective financial contributions of businesses, property owners, and residents
within a specific geographic area, BIDs can generate a dedicated pool of funds to
support initiatives that aim to support regeneration and achieve what is set out in the
Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Voluntary taxation mechanisms like BIDs provide
a means for stakeholders, including organizations and individuals, to directly invest
in the health and resilience of their local ecosystems, fostering a sense of ownership
and responsibility within the community. Additionally, they enable collaborative
partnerships between public and private entities, leveraging resources and
expertise from both sectors to drive meaningful ecological improvements at the
bioregional level. Combined with participatory budgeting (such as outlined in
Section 6.5) Bioregional Tithing can help communities mobilize financial resources
in alignment with their shared values and priorities. One inspiring precedent at the
bioregional scale is the Shuumi Land Tax on Ohlone territory in the East Bay of San
Francisco.

6.10 Advance Market Commitments
 for bioregional regeneration
Similar to offtake agreements, Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) constitute
a promise to purchase or financially support a product upon its successful
development. Governments and private foundations commonly offer AMCs to
incentivize the creation of vaccines or treatments. In return, pharmaceutical
companies agree to supply a specified quantity of doses at a predetermined price.

243 Jeff Emmett et al.: Exploring Bonding Curves: Differentiating Primary and Secondary Automated Market Makers

This funding approach is employed when the expenses associated with research
and development are deemed prohibitive for the private sector without assurance
of a minimum volume of sales. In the space of bioregional regeneration, AMCs can
be used as investment funds committing financial capital to projects that promise
future ecological value and regenerative asset creation, but are risky or expensive
to initiate. Using this tool, financial resources would be guaranteed to ventures, for
example regenerative food startups, that meet certain ecological impact criteria,
providing a stable market for their future development.

6.11 Profit Pooling and whole economy health
 as triggers for investor returns
Building resilient bioregional economies relies on a strong connectivity between
local businesses. In these economies, the financial health of one organization is
inextricably interlinked with that of others and with the whole ecosystem ‚Äì much
like in the web of life in biology. With a Profit Pooling agreement, participating
businesses agree to contribute a defined fair and equal percentage of their
monthly or annual profits to a common insurance pool. This pooling of excess profit
ensures that if any participating business faces cashflow or profitability issues
due to external and uncontrollable circumstances, it can access funds to stabilize
its operations. Profit Pooling has long been utilized in large global corporations
to ensure healthy support between their various subsidiaries; its implementation
within local economies could yield profound benefits that are currently untapped. By
bolstering the resilience of individual businesses, Profit Pooling cultivates resilient
or even anti-fragile enterprise ecosystems, fortifying the fabric of local economies Anti-fragile ‚Äì The quality of a

6.12 Obligation Clearing (also known as
 netting) and Mutual Credit as a liquidity-
 saving mechanism
The practice of debt clearing is centuries old, with origins in 14th century
Italian banking practices. Now, its resurgence using Web3 technologies and
interdisciplinary research that integrates graph and monetary theory offers new
possibilities in leveraging payment graphs and cycles (second order dynamics)
rather than money itself.245 The basic concept is to create greater economic
efficiency and reduce the need for liquidity by clearing debts within a network,
where participant‚Äôs obligations cancel each other out without money or a

single token changing hands. Paired with Mutual Credit in the form of loans on
complementary currency backed by future production, these clearing loops can
save businesses up to 50 percent of their need for cash to settle those debts. This
could offer BFFs and corollary organizations significant savings in operating costs
and provide shelter in high interest rate environments.246

foundations for BFFs. While each story is substantial as a standalone case study,
their real power is found in the synergies between them, and how these linkages
give rise to cascading benefits in the bioregions served by these projects and
organizations. In these examples, Regenerate Cascadia (Case Study 9) emerged
from the Inaugural Edge Prize (Case Study 8), which used Hylo (Case Study 10)

 The Edge Prize ‚Äì Scaling What‚Äôs Possible by
 Supporting and Connecting Regenerative
 Innovators
 By: Edward West

 About the Edge Prize
 The Edge Prize, represents a new methodology for growing a bioregional community
 by hosting a distributed online accelerator and prize challenge. The goals of The Edge
 Prize methodology are to:
 ‚Äî Convene a group of extraordinary entrepreneurs, leaders, and innovators
 throughout a bioregion working on regenerative projects that benefit the lands,
 waters, and people of the bioregion ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Edgewalkers.‚Äù
 ‚Äî Invite them into a supportive community of reciprocity, mentorship, workshops,
 and collaboration.
 ‚Äî Amplify their stories, in order to bring resources, collaboration, partnerships, and
 inspire others to start their own regenerative initiatives ‚Äî in their bioregion and
 beyond.
 ‚Äî Build from these stories a public-facing library of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs working‚Äù to help scale
 and accelerate regenerative practices worldwide.
 Benefiting communities and ecosystems
 The inaugural Edge Prize, piloted in Salmon Nation in 2023, was created by Applied
 Alchemy and the Terran Collective, and sponsored by Salmon Nation Trust and
 the Magic Canoe. The 2023 Edge Prize invited individuals and organizations doing
 something that benefits their community and surrounding ecosystems, offering
 dozens of cash prizes, ranging from $500 to $20,000. Individuals and organizations
 stewarding projects in areas as diverse as Food and Agriculture, Health, Culture and
 Education, Water, Energy, Community Finance and Development, Water, Ecosystem
 Restoration, or Governance sectors were invited to apply, attracting a diverse and
 accomplished collection of 130 leaders and entrepreneurs throughout Salmon Nation.
 Overall, USD 80,000 were distributed to deserving impactful projects in Salmon
 Nation bioregion, with USD 60,000 of that allocated by the community themselves in
 a participatory funding process that supported all participating Edgewalkers to get to
 know each other‚Äôs work.
 All applicants were invited to create a brief written description of their work, as
 well as a short video describing their work. These formed the basis of a public
 open-source library of bioregional solutions. Applicants, along with subject matter
 experts, voted to allocate the prize money to the most compelling applicants.
 Applicants were also invited into an online community, encouraged to discover and
 learn about each other‚Äôs work, and were given access to capacity-building support
 from mentors and subject-matter experts. The overall structure and format of the
 Edge Prize encouraged Edgewalkers to collaborate with each other, and numerous
 self-organizing partnerships emerged during the program. In one example, two
 Edgewalkers partnered with each other to convene the first Edge Prize-inspired event
 series and movement building strategy: Regenerate Cascadia.

 The Edge Prize concept is a template for a broader, open-source movement to
 catalyze critical regenerative innovation in bioregions globally, fitting into a template
 of bioregional transformation on an evolutionary trajectory toward regenerative
 innovation.

 CASE STUDY 9:
 Regenerate Cascadia ‚Äì Coordinated and Coherent
 Bioregional Organizing
 By: Taya Seidler, Clare Attwell, Brandon Letsinger, and Sheri Herndon

 About Regenerate Cascadia
 Regenerate Cascadia is a capacity-building organization and a social movement and
 developing a vision and framework to administer a regeneration fund for Cascadia,
 a bioregion located along the upper Pacific Rim of North America stretching from
 Southeast Alaska to Northern California, and as far east as the Yellowstone Caldera.
 A central goal of Regenerate Cascadia is to grow capacity cohesively across the
 scales of landscapes, ecoregions, and bioregions ‚Äì something that currently does
 not exist locally or globally ‚Äì as part of a multi-generational strategy for the long-term
 health of the Cascadia bioregion. Regenerate Cascadia is addressing the complex
 challenges in funding connected landscape outcomes across a bioregion through a
 whole-systems approach that: prioritizes the central role of place-based stewardship;
 ensures decision-making is held by those at the local level; develops trust-based
 networks that hold the integrity of the work; and uses a nested scale structure to
 facilitate information flow, representation, and learning across the whole system.
 Activating a bioregional movement
 Regenerate Cascadia was formed by Brandon Letsinger and Clare Attwell in April
 2023 during the first ever Salmon Nation Edge Prize, where their vision to activate
 a bioregional movement in Cascadia won the Edge Prize for Innovation in Systems
 and Governance. After months of planning with 100+ local community organizers
 on both sides of the Canada-US border, they partnered with the Design School
 for Regenerating Earth to co-facilitate a month-long Bioregional Activation Tour.
 They traveled to 14 communities around Cascadia during October 2023, hosting
 presentations that asked, ‚ÄúHow do we regenerate the Cascadia bioregion?‚Äù. They
 met with more than 1000 individuals, including Indigenous knowledge keepers,
 regenerative leaders, groups, community artists, and elders across Oregon,
 Washington, and British Columbia through presentations, workshops, site visits,
 and strategy sessions. This was followed by an online summit that brought together
 50+ presentations in a ‚ÄòFestival of What Works‚Äô, and concluded with an Open
 Space Unconference from November 3-12, 2023, where participants cocreated
 working groups for Regenerate Cascadia. The vision resonated strongly with many
 communities across the bioregion. Jay Bowen, an elder of the Skagit people who
 opened the Summit, articulated the following statement in the opening ceremony:
 ‚ÄúGathered before us are the most important people in the world. It may be a small
 group right now, but in a few short years, there's going to be a long line of people
 waiting to get involved in this very important movement that is overseeing the welfare
 of our communities.‚Äù

 Beyond this, Regenerate Cascadia has succeeded in meeting the core challenge
 participatory events often struggle with ‚Äì maintaining momentum and continuous
 engagement among participants. They have an active Telegram channel of 121
 members sharing thousands of messages through 39 subchannels covering specific
 topics and guilds, organizational infrastructure discussions, local communities‚Äô
 individual channels, media and communication, inter alia. The community is thriving
 and members are actively engaging with each other. The Regenerate Cascadia
 community of ‚Äòregenerators‚Äô has since co-developed a digital platform to support the
 work; they continue to collaboratively take in feedback and refine this prototype as
 their ideas and needs evolve.
 A digital landscape
 The digital platform includes a structural framework (see Figure 11.) that prioritizes
 community-led work within a landscape, while thoughtfully aggregating place-
 based projects into larger coordination structures. A ‚Äòfront door‚Äô website is an easy
 entry point for people to learn more, join as a member, donate to specific projects,
 and get more involved. Projects and communities each have a landing page that
 serve as a focal point for local news, resources, and events. These are curated by
 participating communities and are indexable by search engines. The digital platform
 provides an online space to connect within a landscape and across watersheds at
 the nested scales of ecoregions and the Cascadia bioregion. The platform includes
 a comprehensive ‚Äòback end‚Äô suite of tools and resources to support local project
 work, including (i) education and onboarding; (ii) an information commons and
 searchable directories; (iii) a regenerative movement map and relational database;
 and (iv) comprehensive data, measurement, evaluation and reporting capabilities.
 All Regenerate Cascadia programs are part of an integrated 501(c)3 nonprofit
 administrative backend to provide accounting, receive grants, raise funds, deliver
 timely financial reporting, and maintain legal compliance.

 Figure 11. Regenerate Cascadia‚Äôs evolving structural framework for supporting
 bioregional funding

 Regenerate Cascadia‚Äôs living structural framework can be viewed as a system for the
 coherent flow of resources - educational, financial, inspirational, and cultural - that
 supports ongoing bioregional regeneration outcomes and learning. The framework
 enables capital to be distributed from a large bioregional fund into smaller landscape-
 level funds that deliver resources to decentralized projects according to the needs of
 ecoregions and landscapes. This ensures governance power is held by those closest
 to the work through trust-based networks of relationships that connect and align
 diverse projects within a landscape-level vision and strategy. The framework provides
 a comprehensive intermediary between local communities and funders. This enables
 effective cooperation, coordination, and governance across the bioregion to optimize
 strategic outcomes.
 Representing diversity
 A key tenet of the framework is the commitment to the representation of diverse
 voices at all scales, including those of ecosystems and keystone species, ensuring
 that feedback loops from across the whole system enable collective intelligence to
 inform future actions. This supports the whole system to see itself (co-sense), learn
 (co-presence), and iterate (co-create), enabling connected and concurrent local
 and bioregional agency to solve problems at the appropriate scales. Regenerate
 Cascadia‚Äôs structures are built with one of the movement‚Äôs core goals in mind ‚Äì
 to prototype a series of replicable transformational templates that return ‚Äòright
 relationship‚Äô to the Earth as a central organizing premise for finance, while evolving
 how we live and work together cooperatively across scales.
 A core foundation of Regenerate Cascadia are ‚ÄòRegenerate Hubs‚Äô, which hold the
 governance capacity to manage a fund for a discrete landscape across diverse
 stakeholders. Regenerate Hubs operate in several ways, including:
 ‚Äî working with local communities and weaving relationships to develop a long-term
 vision aligned with the overall bioregional vision of Regenerate Cascadia;
 ‚Äî identifying and engaging voices that need to be present;
 ‚Äî maintaining a portfolio of regenerative projects within their defined landscape
 areas;
 ‚Äî stewarding an annual landscape budget; and
 ‚Äî maintaining team coherence.
 Structured for regeneration
 Each Hub has a core team that facilitates/helps establish conditions for cooperation
 and trust and is accountable for administrative and reporting requirements. Each
 landscape features Bioregional Learning Centers that facilitate the cocreation of
 place-based frameworks and serve as foundational education spaces for sense-
 making and decision-making in the community. These centers monitor, evaluate, and
 manage the dynamic flow of an information commons using shared metrics for social,
 cultural, and ecological impact that supports robust fund reporting and continuous
 learning. Hubs primarily collaborate with members of Regenerate Cascadia from
 within a particular landscape, and are represented by a network of Ecoregional
 Councils ‚Äì governance bodies responsible for creating ecoregional budgets that
 maintain the connections between local and bioregional scales.
 Regenerate Cascadia‚Äôs structural framework serves several other core functions in
 supporting landscape leaders, including bioregional ‚ÄòGuilds‚Äô made up of knowledge
 communities responsible for providing tools and resources around specific

 regenerative topics, and connecting learning and networks across landscapes.
 Hubs and Guilds undertake their own projects and activities while sharing news,
 updates, resources, directories, and events for a specific place or topic in a way that
 is meaningful for all participants. Regenerate Cascadia supports the Hubs and Guilds‚Äô
 core teams and services by administering a portion of all funds raised; providing
 opportunities to practice healthy budgeting and governance with small sums of
 money; and growing their decision-making and governance capacities ahead of
 receiving larger flow funding. Finally, the non-profit backbone of Regenerate Cascadia
 is maintained through ‚ÄòBioregional Stewardship Councils‚Äô, which directly assist with
 communications, outreach, fundraising, finance, legal, and reporting requirements,
 and a Bioregional Congress ‚Äì an assembly comprised of Guilds and Ecoregional
 Councils to govern a shared Cascadia bioregional vision.
 Each of the structural components Regenerate Cascadia is collaboratively building
 are demonstrable templates that are adaptable, replicable, and scalable in other
 localities. They are significant, not only for a single bioregion, but as a living framework
 for movements emerging around the world. By connecting and resourcing those
 doing the work in their communities through the support of core backbone teams of
 bioregional weavers; providing knowledge and resource sharing through Guilds that
 weave between landscapes; and co-creating the digital infrastructure for coordination
 and communication, Regenerate Cascadia enables coordinated, coherent processes
 for bioregional learning and regeneration. This framework provides a governance
 model for bioregional funding, enabling capital to flow to where it is needed on the
 ground, and building the foundations for funding the transition to a regenerative
 economy.

 CASE STUDY 10:
 Hylo ‚Äì A Coordination Platform for the Future of
 Bioregional Organizing
 By: Clare Politano

 About Hylo
 Hylo is a community-led, open-source coordination tool for purpose-driven groups,
 with an emphasis on place-based organizing. The free web and mobile apps allow
 community members to deepen relationships and collaborate to get things done
 through discussions, requests, offers, resources, projects, events, geographic maps,
 direct messaging, and chat. All of this is offered without advertising or data-harvesting
 in a clean and simple user interface.
 Hylo is for place-based organizing
 Giving groups tools for local coordination is a particular focus for Hylo, because
 ecological regeneration and community care must happen in a place-based context.
 By using the geographic map, members can share and discover local events,
 resources, and collaborators. Groups can also define their geographic boundary and
 display that on the shared map, which also includes a layer for Native territories that
 can be toggled on and off. Hylo plans to add bioregions as the next map layer.
 Bioregional coordination is already happening on Hylo
 Several bioregions are using Hylo to support connection in their local landscape.

 In 2023, Salmon Nation bioregion used Hylo to convene a community of local leaders,
 the ‚ÄúEdgewalkers,‚Äù throughout Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and
 northern California for an initiative called the Edge Prize. The group gathered on
 Hylo for a series of online relationship-building and educational sessions, and many
 participants also met up in-person and made new local connections. The Edge Prize
 culminated in the Edgewalkers distributing $80,000 in prize money to deserving
 bioregional projects through a participatory budgeting process. The Edgewalkers
 used a different tech tool to conduct the co-budgeting exercise, and in the future this
 function will be built into Hylo.
 After the convening, two Edge Prize participants founded a new bioregional group
 together, Regenerate Cascadia, which went on to organize an in-person bioregional
 activation tour, in-person event series, and online summit all dedicated to ecological
 regeneration and community resilience in Cascadia bioregion. This group remains
 very active on the ground in Cascadia bioregion.
 Other bioregional groups using Hylo include the Bay Area Bioregion, Salish Sea,
 Sacramento River, Appalachia, Thames River Watershed, and Bioregional Weaving
 Labs. People use these groups to share local opportunities and information, meet
 collaborators, and coordinate action - like civic participation in public comments
 related to local environmental policy, or crowdfunding to support the return of land
 to Indigenous tribes. There is also a global community of practice, the Bioregional
 Commons, where place-based organizers from around the world are connecting
 to share and discuss resources relevant to bioregionalism and the transition to
 regenerative bioregional economies.
 Tools for bioregional self-governance
 Through a partnership with OpenTEAM, the Open Technology Ecosystem for
 Agricultural Management, Hylo is building tools to support the transition to
 regenerative agriculture and the participatory governance of purpose-driven,
 collaborative groups. These prosocial tools include space for groups to share their
 purpose and agreements, and prompt members to commit to them; administrative
 tools to curate and assign roles and responsibilities within the group; and coming
 soon, tools for proposals and decision-making. OpenTEAM is using these tools
 to manage collaboration among dozens of sub-awardees - networks of farmers
 and open-source technologists - working together to fulfill a $35M grant to the
 organization from the USDA to support the growth of climate-smart agriculture in the US.
 Combined with Hylo‚Äôs mapping features, these tools to support place-based
 collaboration and governance give bioregional groups the power to steward their
 landscape as a commons. This might, for example, mean the residents of a bioregion
 making proposals for restoration projects or local regenerative businesses, with other
 residents voting on which proposals to support and how to allocate resources among
 them. These tools can be powerful enablers of capital allocation for Bioregional
 Financing Facilities.
 Bioregional DAOs
 Hylo is stewarded by Terran Collective, a bioregional group in the California Bay
 Area whose purpose is to amplify collaboration among people regenerating
 communities and the planet. Terran‚Äôs vision is for bioregional groups on Hylo to grow
 strong collaborative cultures and mature into bioregional DAOs ‚Äì Decentralized
 Autonomous Organizations (see Section 4.7). A DAO is a collaborative organization
 where members decide together how to govern a shared resource or a commons.

 The aim of such a DAO would be to steward the wellbeing of the land and the people,
 with members participating in governance decisions to support this care. Decisions
 could enable the creation of land management agreements, the transition to local
 production and circular economies, advancement of ecological regeneration, and
 improvements in community resilience and climate adaptation.

 ReCommon ‚Äì Regenerative Common Land Trusts
 By: Alex Corren

 About ReCommon
 ReCommon is a US-based organization dedicated to building systems for
 regenerative community land acquisition and governance, using an adaptive
 bioregional framework.
 ReCommon approaches this work on the ‚Äúpattern-level‚Äù to create innovative yet
 grounded solutions that reflect foundational principles in nature. This approach
 is based on the understanding that there are common patterns present in most
 successful solutions, and that identifying and making those patterns accessible to
 others can greatly streamline place-based, on-the-ground action.
 This work includes building governance protocols and legal templates that are
 designed to scale based upon natural patterns, such as land use patterns, community
 design patterns, and regenerative landscape intervention patterns. The groups
 that ReCommon works with then move from the pattern-level to the detail-level
 by adapting these protocols and templates to their place-based projects and
 communities ‚Äì rendering them increasingly decentralized and interoperable, which
 cultivates systemic resilience.
 Hybrid entity structure
 ReCommon‚Äôs hybrid entity structure serves as an integrated bridge between impact
 investment capital and long-term regenerative stewardship of land in Trust by place-
 based bioregional communities. There are three core sister entities are:
 ReCommon Foundation - 501(c)3 nonprofit, cultivating Bioregional Nodes,
 governance and stewardship of land in Trust
 ReCommon Trust - impact investment trust fund, acquires land to be stewarded and
 governed by Bioregional Nodes and other aligned entities
 ReCommon Labs - cooperative that builds digital tools to support the coordination,
 acquisition, and governance of land held in Trust
 These diverse entity structures are able to work closely together towards a common
 goal while leveraging all pathways of capital formation. The Foundation accepts tax-
 exempt donations of all kinds and applies for grant funding, the Trust issues shares
 to investors for the acquisition of land from investors, and Labs accepts a blend of
 investor and non-investor members to build the ReCommon ecosystem.

 Adaptive bioregional governance
 ReCommon‚Äôs place-based governance framework is called the Regenerative
 Community Land Trust (aka RCLT, RegenCLT), which builds upon core principles and
 functionality of the classic CLT model while expanding on it with ecological design
 principles codified into bylaws, leaseholds, and other documents. This model of
 land tenure serves as the foundation for how the land is managed, accessed, and
 stewarded by the community.
 The distinct governance bodies that are responsible for the long-term stewardship
 of land in trust correspond to ecoregions and are called Bioregional Nodes. They
 oversee the agreements for use of the land, manage the Bioregional Node Treasury,
 and submit proposals related to use of funds, and use of land.
 Land is held in Trust and is governed by Bioregional Nodes. Leaseholders access the
 land via long-term renewable leaseholds, and have direct ownership in the structures,
 businesses and activities that happen on the land. Each Node has five key stakeholder
 categories. Each category has equal weight ‚Äì 20 percent ‚Äì regardless of the number
 of members
 ‚Äî Stewards: leaseholders with direct stewardship responsibility for land in Trust
 ‚Äî Elders: members that represent rights of nature and Indigenous wisdom
 ‚Äî Patrons: Commons Credit holders, investors into land held in Trust
 ‚Äî Partners: aligned organizations that are working in and/or with the Node
 ‚Äî General Members: members located in the Node, with no other qualifiers
 This structure allows for larger and smaller coordination bodies to form organically,
 honoring the complexity of relationships within and across landscapes and cultures.
 Securing land for the bioregional commons
 ReCommon Trust raises capital to build a distributed bioregional network of land
 holdings through the issuance of shares known as Commons Credits. CCs directly
 correlate to property acquired by the Trust, and are backed by the value of the land.
 Patrons ‚Äì the owners of CCs ‚Äì have a seat at the table in RCLT governance in the
 Bioregional Node that contains the property.
 Governance of the land held in Trust is explicitly delegated to stewardship entities.
 Bioregional Nodes, via ReCommon Foundation, are the default stewardship entity,
 but the Trust has the flexibility to work with any place-based organization that exists
 specifically to support the multi-generational care of land.
 The Foundation is a significant shareholder in the Trust, which means that when
 profits are generated ‚Äì by scalable leasehold fees, etc. ‚Äì and are distributed to
 shareholders, the Bioregional Node Treasuries are direct recipients of a portion of
 those profits. This serves as the foundation of a regenerative flywheel for resilient
 bioregional economies, where land in Trust generates revenue that is redistributed to
 the community for ongoing support of ecological bioregional initiatives.

 CASE STUDY 12:
 Regenerosity ‚Äì Flowing Capital to Grassroots
 Regeneration by Cultivating Trust
 By: Faith Flanigan and Ruth Andrade

 About Regenerosity
 For over 15 years, the Buckminster Fuller Institute, Lush Spring Prize, and UNDP‚Äôs
 Equator Prize have identified, spotlighted, and funded more than 400 leading and
 upcoming grassroots organizations in the regenerative movement that are delivering
 programs at the nexus of climate, ecology, livelihoods, and sovereignty. Regenerosity
 emerged in 2019 as a collaborative between these prize programs designed to
 bolster the critical role philanthropy has to play during these challenging times by
 leveraging this track-record and experience. Regenerosity works to continually grow
 partnerships, flow resources, and facilitate learning for regenerative grassroots
 organizations.
 To achieve this, Regenerosity thinks systemically. From the understanding that
 regeneration is about creating more capacity and capability to create conditions
 conducive to life, Regenerosity supports a developmental culture throughout all the
 elements of our theory of change by:
 ‚Äî Supporting grassroots, community-led organizations in threatened or degraded
 landscapes through capacity development grants, and by inviting members of
 the communities Regenerosity works with to design participatory trust-based
 programs according to their needs.
 ‚Äî Bringing grantee organizations together in regional peer-to-peer learning circles
 and supporting their connection to other networks and funders.
 ‚Äî Bolstering the critical role of philanthropy by engaging funders in the concepts of
 trust-based and regenerative philanthropy, providing experiences of connection
 to nature (in partnership with Be the Earth Foundation), and attracting further
 funding for grassroots organizations in ways that are more trust-based.
 ‚Äî Creating and promoting grassroots-led stories to share the impact and inspire the
 larger movement.
 ‚Äî Developing Regenerosity into an organization that embodies those principles in
 governance and creates opportunities for its own growth.
 Regenerosity‚Äôs vision is a world where the power of gifting and collaboration can
 nurture thriving communities and grassroots initiatives as they steward ecosystems
 towards vibrant health.
 Regenerosity‚Äôs theory of change
 Regenerosity works across scales through all of their programs. They weave action-
 focused collaboration between grassroots organizations, funders, and key actors to
 develop human capacity to be in right relationship with all living systems by centering:
 ‚Äî Place-based Impact: Co-designing catalytic programs with grassroots
 organizations based on long-term relationships of trust. Flowing capital and
 resources to these organizations so they can grow their impact and potential to
 become regional hubs of regenerative practice.
 ‚Äî Network Collaboration: Bringing organizations together through regional

 communities of peers. Organizations join learning circles in and across cohorts
 for peer-to-peer learning, storytelling, and strategy development.
 ‚Äî Movement Building: Spotlighting evidence and grassroots-led stories that inspire
 the larger movement. Engaging with funders and key actors to influence the field
 of regenerative philanthropy and further attract interest and resources for the
 growth of the grassroots regenerative movement.
 Regenerosity‚Äôs core programs
 Regenerosity‚Äôs core programs are based on shifting the power dynamics of
 philanthropy, catalyzing the work of their partners, and deeply listening and sharing
 their stories.
 Seeds Flow Funds
 The Seed Flow Funds are an experiment in trust-based philanthropy that puts the
 design (and direction) of the fund and decision-making about how the money gets
 spent in the hands of community leaders. The two current funds support ‚ÄúIndigenous
 Women in Brazil‚Äù and ‚ÄúEast African Youth & Women in Permaculture‚Äù.
 In each of these funds, $3,000 is distributed to individuals and groups to lead changes
 in their communities. So far, 13 indigenous women in 12 states across Brazil and 12
 mostly women permaculturists across 3 regions in Uganda and Kenya have delivered
 a diverse array of unique, context-dependent community initiatives. Currently 16 more
 women in Brazil are participating in the second cycle.
 Blossom, capacity strengthening program
 Blossom is a two-year program co-designed with grassroots partners who are
 working to regenerate threatened or degraded landscapes at the intersection of food
 sovereignty, livelihoods, and ecology. Through deploying participatory capital via a
 co-design process, Regenerosity is able to support their grassroots partners‚Äô growth
 and innovation.
 The program develops partners‚Äô organizational capacity, leadership skills, and
 connections, and supports their prototyping of models so that local organizations
 can grow into thriving regional hubs. The 2021-2023 cohort enabled thousands of
 members of Indigenous and local communities to increase food security and secure
 sustainable incomes while protecting and regenerating their traditional lands;
 scaling regionally and/or nationally while partnering with government offices and
 large NGOs; and scaling their programs through additional funding received through
 Regenerosity‚Äôs support.
 Regenerosity has delivered over $1M USD to 11 projects over 2.5 years, including
 supporting:
 ‚Äî 2,500 direct beneficiaries who saw a 76% increase in household income with
 partners YICE Uganda and KAFRED in Bigodi National Park
 ‚Äî a 100% increase in daily household meals in Nakivale Refugee camp with the
 participants of the food program with YICE Uganda
 ‚Äî a 30% increase in water availability for biodiversity and livelihoods through Tarun
 Bharat Sangh across 5 watersheds in India.
 Pollinate storytelling series
 Liberation Agriculture is a film series exploring what true regeneration cultivates. Far
 too often, narratives around regeneration only go soil deep. With the intersections

 of ecological collapse and systemic oppression becoming increasingly clear,
 Regenerosity is sharing stories that interweave the struggle to reclaim ecosystemic
 health and the struggle for collective liberation.
 Nurture Funder Community of Practice
 The Nurture Funder Community of Practice is an aligned community of funders that
 are learning, sharing, and experimenting with allocating financial capital in ways that
 are trust-based, coherent, and inclusive, in order to address social and environmental
 challenges from their roots.
 Regenerosity takes an experimental approach that aims not only at sharing
 knowledge, but also create a call-to-action environment, through helping to evolve the
 capacity of funders for redistributing power, upgrading methodologies, and reframing
 governance structures; creating collaborative prototypes for alternative types of
 funding; and generating stories that inspire other funders to transform their practices.
 Regenerosity believes in the power of shifting catalytic capital through trust-based,
 participatory practices, deep listening, and putting the voices of their partners at the
 forefront. They have catalyzed over 1.5M dollars to grassroots projects and continue
 to iterate and grow their programs.

 8. Next Steps
 and Call to
 Action

 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a time for certain ideas to arrive,
 and they find a way to express themselves through us.‚Äù
 ‚Äì Rick Rubin

Bioregional Finance is an idea whose time has come. There are already many
remarkable organizations, projects, and people working to actualize the spectrum
of ideas and recommendations laid out in this book. We are grateful to them for
inspiring us and feeding into this document.
With the publication of this book, the authors and our many collaborators will now
move from research and template design to designing, building, and implementing
BFFs through partnerships with Bioregional Organizing Teams and by catalyzing
broader action in Bioregional Finance. We invite stakeholders from around the
world, working across disciplines and sectors, to engage with us and with each
other to support the decentralization of financial resource governance, the design
of project portfolios for systemic change, and the transition to regenerative
economies. We recognize that while there is no single solution to the polycrisis,
Bioregional Finance can catalyze a global place-based movement that shifts value
structures, and enables each of us to contribute to healing the Earth and culture in
our unique ways.
In Table 12 below we lay out some potential actions for key categories of actors.247
While no two bioregions will follow the same path, we hope that through shared
learning and prototyping we can rapidly advance the field of Bioregional Finance
in an emergent, evolutionary way. While many of these actions may on the surface
look like to-do list items to check off, we suggest that they are all ‚Äì including the most
technocratic and technical ‚Äì recommendations to form and nurture relationships
of care, trust, healing, reciprocity, clear communication, and mutual learning. We
look forward to embarking on this journey with all of you. The forthcoming BioFi
Community of Practice on Hylo will be a key place for us all to engage.

247 These actions are not intended to be prescriptive and are not linear. We understand bioregional regeneration to be
 a complex, dynamic flow of actions and relations across multiple nested scales within a landscape and hope for
 these actions to support that process. We encourage you to consider that by reading this book, you are already an
 active participant in this movement, whether or not you identify with one of these categories. We encourage you to be
 curious about actions and relationships not listed that may be right for you to engage in.

 accumulated capital is sequestered for the growing, maturing ecosystem, it also represents a gradual increase in
 the potential for other kinds of ecosystems and futures. For an economic or social system, the accumulating potential
 could as well be from the skills, networks of human relationships, and mutual trust that are incrementally developed
 and tested during the progression from exploitation to conservation. Those also represent a potential developed and

 Glossary

 Glossary
Anti-fragility ‚Äì The quality of a system, entity, or process that allows it to not only
withstand ‚Äî but actually benefit and grow stronger from ‚Äî stress, volatility, and
uncertainty. Unlike fragile systems, which break under stress, or robust systems,
which withstand stress without changing, anti-fragile systems thrive and improve in
response to challenges and disruptions.

Biocultural regeneration ‚Äì A holistic and interconnected approach to revitalizing
and restoring ecosystems, biodiversity, and cultural practices in a given spatial
context. It recognizes the interdependence of nature and culture, emphasizing the
importance of Indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices in stewarding
ecosystems.

Biodiversity ‚Äì Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variety and variability of life
on Earth. Biodiversity is a measure of variation at the genetic (genetic variability),
species (species diversity), and ecosystem (ecosystem diversity) level.260

Bioregion ‚Äì A region defined by unique physical characteristics (climate,
topography), ecological characteristics (such as soil, flora, fauna, and fungi), cultural
characteristics (such as language, art, and identity), and their interconnections.
There are many differing definitions of the scale and boundaries of bioregions,261
and this book celebrates this diversity as a critical insight about the lack of any
firm boundaries in ecosystems and the need to work with neighbors in bioregional
organizing.

Bioregional Hub ‚Äì A community-led institution that functions as a gathering place
(physical and/or virtual), resource center, and facilitator of various regeneration-
related activities, initiatives, and networks within a bioregion. While Bioregional
Hubs can offer educational and capacity building programs, much like Bioregional
Learning Centers do, their focus extends to facilitating the flow of multiple forms of
capital (intellectual, social, cultural, etc.). They cohere and strengthen a synergistic
bioregional collaboration network by fostering connections and partnerships, and
catalyzing projects and initiatives that align with the Bioregional Regeneration
Strategy. See 3.3 Bioregional Hubs for detailed description.

260 UNEP: What is biodiversity?
261 One Earth: What is a bioregion? 22 ways to define a bioregion

Bioregional Learning Center (BLC) ‚Äì An educational hub for gathering and
synthesizing knowledge about local ecology and culture.262 Centers typically
focus on education, research, and skill-building related to the specific ecological,
cultural, and social aspects of a bioregion. They offer various programs, workshops,
mutual learning exchanges, and courses that focus on topics such as ecology,
permaculture, sustainable living practices, Indigenous knowledge, and local history.
The primary goal is to provide opportunities for individuals and communities to
deepen their understanding of the unique characteristics and challenges of their
bioregion while equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary for
regenerative living and stewardship in place.

Bioregionalism ‚Äì A socio-political and ecological philosophy that advocates for the
alignment of economic activity, ecological management, and governance with the
natural systems and cultures of "bioregions," defined by unique physical, ecological,
and cultural characteristics, and their interconnections. Bioregionalism suggests
that the invisible and visible regenerative efforts occurring across multiple scales
(individual, family, neighborhood, community, organization, ecoregion, global) can
be anchored and organized in large, bioculturally coherent landscapes that federate
through affinity, solidarity, and reciprocity to fulfill planetary potential.263

Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF) ‚Äì A community-owned institution that applies a
participatory, transparent, and place-based approach to driving the decentralization
of financial resource governance, design of project portfolios for systemic change,
and the transition to a regenerative economy. While a BFF specializes in facilitating
the flow of financial capital between regenerative projects, community members,
and investors, it also works in close relationship with a Bioregional Hub to facilitate
the flow of all capital types (e.g social, intellectual, cultural) in holistic support
of bioregional regeneration. See 4. Designing and Implementing Bioregional
Financing Facilities for detailed discussion, templates, and case studies.

Bioregional Organizing Team ‚Äì A team of local stakeholders that initiates a
bioregional regeneration and governance process, activates other stakeholders,
builds networks of relationality and trust, and facilitates the collective regeneration
efforts. See 3.1 Bioregional organizing and value creation for detailed discussion.

Bioregional Regeneration Strategy ‚Äì A co-created, 20-100+ year or
multigenerational plan for regenerating a particular bioregion, including a guide to
the worldviews, values, processes, and principles recommended in approaching
the work. Strategies are ideally built upon comprehensive mapping and systemic
analysis and employ long-term thinking. See 3.1 Bioregional organizing and value
creation for detailed discussion.

262 Joe Brewer: What is a Bioregional Learning Center?
263 This is articulated in the vision, mission, and goals of the Regenerative Communities Network.

Bioregional Tithing ‚Äì A program through which citizens residing or organizations
operating in the bioregion opt to ‚Äútithe‚Äù by donating a certain amount annually
or monthly (based on their income or profits) to the Bioregional Trust to support
regeneration of the bioregion they are tasked with stewarding. This program
recognizes that while all humans are meant to be stewards of the lands and waters
of their place, some are better placed to do this work directly, while others can
support them with financial resources. Inspiration can be taken from the Ohlone
Sogorea Te‚Äô Land Trust and its calculator for the voluntary Shuumi Land Tax.264

Biosphere ‚Äì The thin life-supporting stratum of Earth‚Äôs surface, extending from a few
kilometers into the atmosphere to the deep-sea vents of the ocean. It is composed
of living organisms and nonliving factors from which the organisms derive energy
and nutrients. The biosphere supports all life on Earth, estimated at 3 to 30 million
species of plants, animals, fungi, single-celled prokaryotes such as bacteria, and
single-celled eukaryotes such as protozoans.265

Carbon-tunnel vision ‚Äì A myopic perspective that ignores the multiple
interdependent socio-ecological system crises that we face to focus only on carbon
emissions, and/or focuses solely on carbon emissions reductions as the key climate
change response.266

Cascading benefits ‚Äì A term coined by Buckminster Fuller used to describe how
benefits from one well-designed change in a system can create enabling conditions
for other beneficial changes.

Common assets (also referred to as commons) ‚Äì A type of resource that is
collectively owned, used, or engaged with by a group of people. Commons can
range from local resources like forests, fisheries, and urban spaces, to global
resources like the biosphere, atmosphere, digital networks, and data. Elinor
Ostrom's work challenged the traditional notion that commons are inevitably
subject to degradation or overuse ("the tragedy of the commons"), and instead
demonstrated through empirical studies that communities are capable of
developing effective rules and institutions to sustainably manage and govern
commons over the long term.267 ‚ÄúCommoning‚Äù and ‚Äúre-commoning‚Äù are also
coming into increasing use as verbs to describe the practice of forming and
governing new commons or recovering historical commons from a present
privatized state.

Community organizing, weaving, and activation ‚Äì The processes of gathering,
facilitating connection between, and empowering community towards a shared
purpose and vision. The Bioregional Weaving Labs consortium outlines five core
Weaving Practices: Helping systems see and sense themselves; Cultivating trust-
based relationship; Aligning on a shared purpose and vision; Facilitating collective
(un)learning; Fostering (experimental) action.268

Complementary currencies ‚Äì A form of currency or exchange medium that
operates alongside the national currency system, providing a means of transaction
and value exchange within a specific community or network. They are designed to
complement rather than replace national currencies and ‚Äúto facilitate transactions
that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt occur, linking otherwise unused resources to unmet needs,
and encouraging diversity and interconnections that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù269
Complementary currencies can take various forms including local currencies, time-
based currencies, rewards programs, or digital/blockchain-based tokens.

Conviction Voting ‚Äì An approach to collective decision-making where individuals
continuously express their preferences for the proposals they wish to support. They
may change their preferences at any time, but the longer they maintain their support
for a specific proposal, the greater the "strength" of their conviction becomes. This
gives community members with consistent preferences more influence than short-
term participants who may only seek to sway a single vote.270

Decentralization ‚Äì The distribution of decision-making authority and management
responsibilities away from a centralized or top-down authority and toward a larger
group of diverse representatives, aiming to improve the efficiency, effectiveness,
and responsiveness of information processing, coordination, and decision-making
(notably, resource allocation).

Eco-credits ‚Äì Attestations (i.e. validations) about ecological state which prove
regeneration is occurring, has occurred, or will occur. It is our recommendation
that eco-credits are based on community-developed and governed definitions of
regeneration that are rooted in local context and include a composition of ecological
factors (rather than a single, non-local parameter, such as carbon).271

Ecological integrity ‚Äì The ability of an ecosystem to support and maintain ecological
processes and a diverse community of organisms.272

Ecoregion ‚Äì A relatively large area of land or water that contains a geographically
distinct assemblage of plant and animal communities. Ecoregions can generally be
understood as encompassing biome subtypes (e.g. a grassland prairie biome can
include multiple different grassland ecoregions ‚Äî tall grass, short grass, etc.).

Ecotones ‚Äì A transition area between two ecosystems where they meet and
integrate. It may be narrow or wide, and it may be local (the zone between a field
and forest) or regional (the transition between forest and grassland ecosystems).
An ecotone may appear on the ground as a gradual blending of the two ecosystems
across a broad area, or it may manifest itself as a sharp boundary line.273

Emergence ‚Äì ‚ÄúEmergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise out
of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions.‚Äù It is these ‚Äúsimple interactions‚Äù ‚Äì
from how we relate to the thoughts in our own heads, to how we show up in our
relationships, to how we exist as local communities ‚Äì that create the patterns that
give rise to our ecosystems and societies.274

Financial sector ‚Äì The segment of the global economy composed of institutions and
markets that facilitate the flow of funds between savers, borrowers, and speculators
managing financial assets and liabilities. It differs from the real sector, which
involves the production and exchange of tangible goods and services.

Financialization ‚Äì A trend in which financial instruments and markets exert
disproportionate influence over real economic activities and policy, prioritizing
short-term speculative gains for the financial sector over long-term productivity and
health in the real sector.

Fractal ‚Äì A pattern comprising parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the
whole, displaying self-similarity across scales. In nature, fractals can be observed
in patterns such as snowflakes, mountain ranges, and the branching of trees, blood
vessels, and watersheds.

Gaia Hypothesis ‚Äì Introduced in the early 1970s by James E. Lovelock and Lynn
Margulis, the Gaia Hypothesis posits that Earth and its biological systems behave
as a single, global entity with closely controlled self-regulatory negative feedback
loops that keep the conditions on the planet within boundaries that are favorable
to life. This way of looking at global ecology and evolution differs from the classical
picture of ecology as a biological response to a menu of physical conditions.275

Indigenous ‚Äì produced, growing, living, or occurring natively or naturally in a
particular region or environment.276

Indigenous peoples ‚Äì A term holding immense complexity that is best defined within
specific context.277 However, for general interpretation throughout this book, we
suggest the term be understood as members ‚Äúof a community retaining memories
of life lived sustainably on a land-base, as part of that land-base,‚Äù278 particularly
peoples practicing non-colonial knowledge systems rooted in relationships of
reciprocity with more-than-human life, and as a term of self-identification used by
those with ‚Äúa special relationship with their traditional territory and an experience of
subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.‚Äù279 Note: In some
geographic contexts, ‚ÄòFirst Nations‚Äô is used as a more specific term.280

274 adrienne maree brown: Emergent Strategy
275 ScienceDirect: Gaia Hypothesis
276 Merriam-Webster: Indigenous
277 We encourage great care with this term and caution against simplistic categorizations that ignore historical contexts
 of interrelatedness between peoples, and between all peoples and the entire land-base of Earth. We encourage deep
 listening and relationship-building with sources of Indigenous knowledge and dialogue in your contexts.
278 This quotation is sourced from Tyson Yunkaporta‚Äôs book Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World,
 which is an excellent resource for engaging with the depth and complexity of this term.
279 Wikipedia: Indigenous peoples
280 ‚ÄòFirst Nations‚Äô is often used to identify Indigenous peoples of Canada (who are neither Inuit nor M√©tis) and to
 identify people with familial heritage from, and membership in, the ethnic groups that lived in Australia before British
 colonization.

Investment ‚Äì For this book we have chosen to use the terms ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù and
‚Äúinvesting‚Äù to describe all processes of providing financial resources. This builds on
an understanding that all forms of financial capital provision (equity, debt, donations,
grant-making, etc.) ideally yield returns, as in the traditional notion of ‚Äúinvestment.‚Äù
However, sometimes these investments are designed to return financial capital and
at other times additional or other forms of capital (see ‚ÄúMulti-capital‚Äù). ‚ÄúInvestment‚Äù
can also be used to describe the provision of non-financial capital, although this
book does not apply this meaning.

Islands of coherence ‚Äì Ilya Prigogine, a renowned theoretical physicist and chemist,
used the concept of "islands of coherence" to describe emergent phenomena
in complex systems, particularly localized regions within a complex system
where coherence or order emerges spontaneously amidst overall disorder or
randomness. These islands of coherence are characterized by temporary stability
or organization that arises due to nonlinear interactions and feedback processes
within the system.

Kinship ‚Äì Encomposses a complex and interconnected understanding of
relationships, identity, and responsibilities within human and more-than-human
communities. It is not merely a biological or legal concept, but encompasses
spiritual, cultural, familial, and historical dimensions.

Land Back ‚Äì Also referred to with hashtag #LandBack, is a decentralized campaign
by Indigenous Australians, Indigenous peoples in Canada, Native Americans in the
United States, other Indigenous peoples, and allies alike, that seeks to reestablish
Indigenous sovereignty, with political and economic control of their ancestral
lands. Land Back promotes a return to communal land ownership of traditional and
unceded Indigenous lands and rejects colonial concepts of real estate and private
land ownership.281

Living in relationship to place ‚Äì Having an intentional, embodied, and perhaps
spiritual connection and responsibility to specific lands, ecology, and place-
based culture. In contrast, many people in modern culture may experience a
‚Äúplacelessness‚Äù ‚Äì a disconnection from geographic roots due to factors like
globalization, technological change, and dominant culture that considers humans
as separate from nature.

Living system ‚Äì Living systems, as contrasted with nonliving complex systems
‚Äì such as the stock market, computer simulations, or car traffic patterns ‚Äì are
characterized by the following set of key features: complexity, self-organization,
interdependence, nested hierarchies, dynamic balance, and the emergent
properties of cognition, adaptation, and autopoiesis ‚Äì the capability of a system to
produce and maintain itself by producing its own parts.282

Monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) ‚Äì A process that ensures accuracy,
reliability, and transparency in reporting and measurements. The goal of MRV
is to verify that the data and information presented in reports, statements, or
performance measurements are truthful, consistent, and compliant with applicable
standards and regulations.

More-than-human life ‚Äì A phrase that intentionally values all living beings and
elements of the natural world as interconnected and integral to life. This concept
emphasizes the agency, consciousness, and relational significance of non-human
entities.

Multi-capital/Multicapitalism ‚Äì A framework that acknowledges and values different
forms of capital beyond traditional financial capital. A wide diversity of multi-capital
frameworks and definitions ‚Äì including Indigenous concepts ‚Äì have been proposed
in recent years to offer language for breaking out of the perception that money is the
only form of capital flowing around and through us.

Natural assets ‚Äì The stocks of natural resources and ecosystems that provide
essential services and benefits to Gaia, society, local economies, and the global
economy. These assets include forests, wetlands, fisheries, clean air and water,
biodiversity, and other elements of the natural environment that contribute to the
well-being of life and economic prosperity.

Nature ‚Äì Perhaps an undefinable term (e.g. where does it end?) it is mostly used in
this book to refer to the organic world (plants, fungi, animals (including humans),
ecosystems) as well as world features (hydrology, geology, climate) that western
science does not generally consider organic or alive, yet are being increasingly
recognized as interdependent with the organic world (see Gaia Hypothesis). Within
the context of other knowledge systems, it includes categories such as Mother
Earth and systems of life, and it is often viewed as inextricably linked to humans, not
as a separate entity.283

Nature-based Currencies ‚Äì A type of complementary currency that bases its value
on the health and vitality of the local ecosystems ‚Äì the ecological wealth ‚Äì in a
given bioregion. While most currencies in circulation today are no longer linked to
physical assets, such as gold, communities deploying these new currencies can
use natural capital as a reserve asset to mint the financial capital needed to protect
ecosystems and support the livelihoods of their local stewards.284

Partner states ‚Äì Multi-stakeholder cooperatives or commons-based institutions
responsible for the management and provision of certain public goods, common
assets, or services that were once the responsibility of state governments, which
instead provide funding and performance evaluation to partner states.285

283 IPBES: nature
284 Inspired by Open Earth Foundation: Nature Based Currencies
285 P2P Foundation Wiki: Partner State

Place ‚Äì Where geographic reality and human culture intersect. It is the foundation
for culture and economy.286

Planetary boundaries ‚Äì A scientific framework that presents a set of nine
biophysical thresholds, ‚Äúwithin which humanity can continue to develop and thrive
for generations to come.‚Äù Crossing boundaries increases the risk of generating
large-scale abrupt or irreversible ecological changes.287

Polycrisis ‚Äì ‚ÄúA time of great disagreement, confusion, or suffering that is caused
by many different problems happening at the same time so that they together
have a very big effect,‚Äù (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). Polycrisis is often used
interchangeably with ‚ÄúMetacrisis‚Äù, although some assert that ‚Äúmeta-‚Äù offers
a preferable distinction by denoting the interdependence (rather than mere
multiplicity) of crises and the worldviews/values that may be generating these
crises.288

Public good ‚Äì In economics, a ‚Äúpublic good" refers to anything that is both non-
excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning people cannot be barred access, and one
person's use doesn't degrade another's.289 Street lights, public databases, and
open-source patents or code are all examples. Public goods are different from
common assets, which can be rivalrous and made excludable through governance.

R Values ‚Äì Jan Hania (Tuwharetoa, Raukawa-ki-teTonga, Te Atiawa of Aotearoa/
New Zealand and the Principal of Strategy Development for Biome Trust) uplifts
the ‚ÄúR values‚Äù of relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence,
regeneration, redistribution, and reconnection ‚Äì noting that language must
be contextualized and place-based.290 The authors also uplift re-membering,
restorying, rewilding, and rematriation.

Real sector ‚Äì the part of the global economy that produces goods and services,
rather than the part that consists of financial institutions and services.

Regeneration ‚Äì The process of a system regaining its needed energies, resources,
and relationships to vitalize and sustain. Contrasted with ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù, which
is oriented towards preserving and minimizing negative impacts, regeneration is
oriented towards restoring and revitalizing systems that have been degraded.

Regenerator ‚Äì The individuals, communities, organizations, and networks actively
engaging in biocultural regeneration efforts. The specifier ‚Äúon-the-ground‚Äù refers to
those working in consistent, embodied, and intimate relationship with ecosystems
and landscapes.

Returns ‚Äì The outcomes (normally assumed to be positive, but could include
negative) generated for investors, stakeholders, and human and more-than-human
community across multiple forms of capital as a result of investments or actions.

Rights of nature ‚Äì The recognition that our ecosystems ‚Äì including trees, oceans,
animals, and mountains ‚Äì have rights just as human beings have rights. Rather than
treating nature as property under the law, rights of nature acknowledges that nature
in all its life forms has the right to exist, persist, maintain, and regenerate its vital
cycles. And we ‚Äì the people ‚Äì have the legal authority and responsibility to enforce
these rights on behalf of ecosystems. The ecosystem itself can be named as the
injured party, with its own legal standing rights, in cases alleging rights violations.291

Right relationship/ right relation ‚Äì As an aspirational quality or state of relationality
that can only be encountered in a unique web of relations and biocultural
understanding, it is not possible to offer a comprehensive and specific definition
of this term. Generally, however, ‚Äúright relationship‚Äù connotes a harmonious way
of relating that is active, reciprocal, consensual, and sustainable (or regenerative)
across dimensions of past, present, and future, with respect to humans, more-than-
human-life, lands, and waters. The term is most often used to refer to Indigenous
ways of relating. Therefore, we recommend learning about relationality directly
from Indigenous sources and relationships, as translation across languages and
worldviews risks eroding its essential meaning.292

Stewardship ‚Äì The responsible and ethical relating, tending, and nurturing of land,
resources, and ecosystems for the benefit of present and future generations of
human and more-than- human communities. Stewardship emphasizes a holistic
approach that prioritizes the well-being of the entire ecological system over
individual ownership rights, focusing on sustainability, resilience, and regeneration
of natural capital.293

Steward-ownership ‚Äì A corporate ownership structure that presents an alternative
to shareholder value primacy. It ensures that companies prioritize their long-term
purpose over short-term profits ‚Äì by legally enshrining two principles of Self-
Determination and Purpose-Orientation.294

Story of place ‚Äì A holistic narrative that integrates the history, ecology, culture,
and potential of a specific location, guiding sustainable design and development
processes rooted in community stewardship and alignment with living systems
principles. Note: Story of Place¬Æ refers to a specific educational concept and service
offering of the Regenesis Group.295

293 A note of caution for spanish speakers: steward is often translated as ‚Äòmayordomo‚Äô ‚Äì a term originating from colonial
 structures of domination and control of land and people. ‚ÄòCuidador/a‚Äô or ‚Äòguardiano/a‚Äô are closer to the intended
 meaning.
294 Purpose Economy: What's steward-ownership?

Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) ‚Äì The ongoing accumulation of knowledge,
practice, and belief about relationships between living beings in a specific
ecosystem that is acquired by Indigenous people over hundreds or thousands
of years through direct contact with the environment, handed down through
generations, and used in life-sustaining ways. It encompasses the world view of a
people, which includes ecology, spirituality, human and animal relationships, and
more.296

Transcontextual ‚Äì The recognition that complex systems do not exist in single
contexts, but rather are formed between multiple contexts that overlap in living
communication and among living systems. ‚ÄúWarm Data‚Äù can be defined as:
Transcontextual information about the interrelationships that integrate a complex
system.297

Quadratic Funding ‚Äì By allocating funds based on a quadratic formula that
magnifies the impact of many small investments from the community (similar to
crowdfunding) through a so-called ‚Äòmatching pool‚Äô that is resourced by larger
capital providers, Quadratic Funding encourages widespread participation and
fosters a diverse array of projects that resonate with local communities. Projects
that receive a given amount of community funding from a broader base of
individuals receive more match funding than those that receive the given amount
from only a few community investors.298

Quadratic Voting ‚Äì A method of collective decision-making where individuals assign
votes to reflect both the direction and intensity of their preferences. Participants can
allocate more votes to express stronger support for specific options, allowing them
to "purchase" additional votes on a particular matter, thereby aligning the voting
outcome with the highest willingness to pay, rather than solely the preference of the
majority. Payments for votes can be made using either artificial or real currencies,
such as voting tokens distributed equally among voting members or fiat and
complementary currencies with actual economic exchange value.299 (Lalley and
Weyl, 2018)

Wealth ‚Äì True wealth is not merely money in the bank. It must be defined
and managed in terms of the well-being of the whole, achieved through the
harmonization of multiple kinds of wealth or capital, including social, cultural, living,
and experiential. It must also be defined by a broadly shared prosperity across all of
these varied forms of capital. The whole is only as strong as the weakest link.300

Weaving ‚Äì Weaving is the practice of cultivating meaningful relationships, within,
between and across socio-ecological systems. It connects people, projects, and
places in synergistic and purposeful ways to help cohere fragmented change-
making efforts. It seeks to strengthen the socio-ecological fabric and the system‚Äôs
resilience by addressing the vital and relational aspects of trust, common meaning,
capacity for learning, and capacity for self-organization.301

Web3 ‚Äì In contrast to the current internet era (Web2) characterized by centralized
platforms and services where user data is controlled by a few large corporations,
Web3 represents an emerging internet that is decentralized, enabled by blockchain
technology, where users have greater control over their data, identities, and
interactions through peer-to-peer networks and protocols.

Worldview ‚Äì ‚ÄúA set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially
true or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or
inconsistently) about the basic makeup of our world.‚Äù302
