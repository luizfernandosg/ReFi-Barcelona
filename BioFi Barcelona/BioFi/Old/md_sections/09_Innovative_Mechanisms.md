Regeneration
A series of innovative financial tools and approaches is emerging that can help to
capitalize BFFs and support the transition of a bioregional economy. Some worth
mentioning include:

— Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Web3-based eco-credits
— (Digital) Nature-based Currencies
— Local Market Networks & Bioregional Vouchers
— Bioservices Banks
— Participatory grant-making through quadratic and Conviction Voting
— Quadratic Funding and Equity Crowdfunding as proxies for capital allocation
— Place-based Bioregional Tithing, voluntary taxation, and Business Improvement
 Districts
— Advance Market Commitments for bioregional regeneration
— Profit Pooling and whole-economy health as triggers for investor returns

Many of the themes explored in this book are aligned with the values and patterns
driving the decentralized finance or “DeFi” movement. The authors believe that the
potential of existing protocols, tools, technologies, and templates in the Web3 space
to bolster the bioregional movement and supercharge grassroots regeneration, has
– as yet – not been realized.

11 For example: relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence, regeneration, redistribution, and
 reconnection

health. They can measure and trace such indicators as carbon sequestration,
biodiversity indices, erosion mitigation, water conservation, social prosperity and
wellbeing, and cultural integrity indicators like Indigenous ancestral stewardship.
(see case study on Regen Network below). These eco-credits can be tokenized and
traded on decentralized marketplaces, allowing stakeholders to invest in bioregional
regeneration initiatives. It is important to recognize that these eco-credits are not
primarily designed to “offset” destructive activities, as in the case of conventional
carbon credits. They can play a much more flexible role in recording the
community-determined value of a set of regenerative actions, and they can identify
the value flows of biodiversity and ecosystem services in need of preservation or
regeneration and validate effective action taken. Eco-credits can support the shift
to more pluralistic approaches to assessing value within a bioregion. This enables a
more transparent view of financial beneficiaries so buyers can make more informed
choices that align with economies rooted in equity and commons stewardship.

The joint ownership and authorship of eco-credits is made possible through
decentralized protocols in the form of blockchain-powered DAOs. DAOs can
be understood as an evolution of commons, combining digital governance with
common pool resource management. They enable decentralized decision-
making and resource allocation within a community, leveraging smart contracts,
to automate the distribution of funds for bioregional regeneration projects based
on predefined criteria and community consensus. Through DAOs and Web3-
based eco-credits, communities can mobilize financial resources in a transparent,
accountable, and decentralized manner. Examples of DAOs innovating to support
regeneration include Gitcoin, Kolektivo, and Big Green DAO.

Ecological Institutions use decentralized protocols to enable the creation of
novel legal and economic actors, which would not be possible in a conventional
centralized system of ownership, sensing, and governance. These Institutions
enable non-conventional ecological actors, like non-human organisms,
ecosystems, and even whole bioregions, to own their own currency, deeds, and
information held on their unique blockchain address (See more in the Regen
Network case study below).232

 CASE STUDY 6:
 Regen Network and Eco-Credits - A Novel Funding
 Mechanism for Regeneration
 By: Austin Wade Smith

 About the Regen Network
 Established on the belief that land stewards and local communities should define
 what eco-social regeneration looks like in their context, the Regen Network is an
 open source technology stack and blockchain dedicated to the redefinition of value,
 away from extraction, towards planetary regeneration. At the core of the project, is
 the belief that the instruments used to align finance with environmental wellbeing

232 Regen Foundation: Ecological Institutions → Protocols to Grow Autonomous and Convivial Ecological Actors

 must be owned and governed by communities practicing regeneration. One of the
 primary instruments in achieving this are eco-credits, a novel funding mechanism
 that can support the protection of ecosystems and the stewardship practices which
 regenerate them. An eco-credit can be understood as an evolution of ecosystem
 service credits used in climate finance, like carbon credits, with several critical
 differences. Credits function like a discrete unit of value – fungible, non-fungible, or a
 combination of both – within a regenerative economic paradigm. Unlike philanthropy
 or impact investing, which allocate resources to critical habitats and people who need
 it most, regenerative economics redefines value at its root, arguing that ecosystems
 and their steward relationships produce value while alive and intact through their life-
 sustaining ecosystem functions, not just as commodities and raw materials.

 Attesting to data is a way to validate a piece of data and is comparable to signing a
 legal document – implying the contents of the data are accepted to be true by the
 attestor to the best of their knowledge.
 Governance
 The dynamic composition of eco-credits reflects the belief that regeneration looks
 like different measures, indices, and practices in different places. Eco-credits are
 reflections of their biocultural context. Rather than top-down prescriptions of what
 regeneration looks like across different contexts endemic to climate finance, the
 composition of eco-credits must reflect the people, bioregion, and a larger story of
 place. The definition and creation of an eco-credit is coauthored by the larger group of
 stakeholders through governance processes:
 — The primary author of the terms and composition of an eco-credit is the
 bioregional community directly responsible for the stewardship.
 — Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs), ecosystem guardians and
 protectors must hold the primary authority for what biocultural indicators mark the
 composition of a credit.
 — This bottom up definition of value is corroborated with external stakeholders, like
 the scientific community, as well credit purchasers.
 A process of co-authorship for the definition of value beginning with stewards

 themselves means the identity and wellbeing of the communities doing the direct
 work of restoring and protecting ecosystems are centered in the design and
 development of eco-credits.
 Definition through decentralized protocols
 The joint ownership and authorship of eco-credits is made possible through
 decentralized protocols in the form of DAOs. DAOs can be understood as an evolution
 of commons, wedding digital governance with common pool resource management.
 They are a hybrid of digital knowledge commons and biospheric commons. DAOs can
 be bioregionally defined; in bioregional DAOs, the members who govern the DAO are
 bound by a particular region and may include the grassroots communities directly
 responsible for the regenerative work like IPLC’s, local stewards, community boards,
 and guardians. DAOs may also be defined by association as guild DAOs, where
 members who govern the DAO are affiliated by shared knowledge and expertise –
 like scientific peer communities, supply chains, and impact verifiers. Designing the
 governance model between bioregional and guild DAOs allows different stakeholders
 to interact in a facilitated manner to govern the composition, roles, and terms of
 eco-credits. This is particularly important for the co-authoring of credits between
 originators and purchasers. It also allows all aspects of the creation of eco-credits to
 be transparent as appropriate, auditable, and thus continuously accountable to the
 claims and attestations they define.
 Ecological Institutions
 Additionally, the use of decentralized protocols enables the creation of novel legal
 and economic actors, which would not be possible in a conventional centralized
 system of ownership, sensing, and governance. Decentralized protocols enable non-
 conventional ecological actors, like non-human organisms, ecosystems, and even
 whole bioregions to own their own currency, deeds, and information. Ecosystems
 are in effect autonomous funds or trusts of information and currency that disperse
 resources towards different stakeholders or initiatives based on the satisfaction of
 contractual conditions. These entities, broadly referred to as Ecological Institutions,
 are an integration of regenerative economics enabled by blockchains and DAOs
 with the rights of nature movement, proposed by the emerging field of Earth law.
 Legal personhood and other designations allow organisms, ecosystems, and whole
 bioregions to own their own currency, data, and contracts in digital form. This means
 non-humans are able to legally possess digital currencies, digital files, and data
 sets, as well as digital copies of contracts and deeds. The design and definition of
 Ecological Institutions is an area for significant potential research, which integrates
 social governance practices with data inputs in the form of oracles. Oracles can
 be understood as ecological sensing systems which deliver data about the state of
 ecosystems and organisms as inputs into software systems, controlling the behavior
 of algorithms based on conditions in the environment. Ecological Institutions may
 issue, own, or coordinate the creation and circulation of eco-credits using a stack like
 the Regen Network. A comprehensive introduction to this topic can be found in the
 paper, Ecological Institutions by Austin Wade Smith, Regen Foundation, and Earth Law
 Center.
 Programmable circulation
 The relationship between eco-credits and decentralized protocols allows finer control
 over the terms and conditions of credit sales. Originators of eco-credits are able to
 specify to whom credits can or cannot be sold, as well as the terms of their fungibility
 or expiration. This allows the nature of the credit circulation to be programmable

 by the originators. We broadly refer to the ability to control how credits are sold, to
 whom, and the terms of their resale as programmable circulation, because unlike
 conventional financial systems, eco-credits issued and exchanged on blockchains,
 allow originators of credits to specify the conditions of how eco-credits are
 transacted.
 While enabled by decentralized protocols of ownership and governance,
 decentralized protocols are not required. The principle of community ownership
 around the terms and definition of regeneration at a local level lies at the heart of what
 an eco-credit is. As such, they may be implemented across a wide range of systems,
 which do not run on top of decentralized ledger technologies like blockchains.
 Regen Network works to scale joint trust agreements between originators and
 purchasers around context-specific regenerative action in the form of high integrity
 eco-credits. The Network supports an international community of practitioners and
 project developers designing and issuing eco-credits through the Regen Network
 app. Monthly eco-credit Builder Labs support and catalyze credit development, and
 are a good entry point into learning more about the relation of eco-credits to BFFs.

6.2 (Digital) Nature-based Currencies
Bioregional Banks could issue complementary Nature-based Currencies that
base their value on the health and vitality of the local ecosystems - the ecological
wealth - in a given bioregion. While most currencies in circulation today are no
longer linked to physical assets such as gold, these new currencies would be tied
to natural assets – fostering a symbiotic relationship between local economies and
ecosystems. With this form of bioregional, asset-backed currency, BFFs could issue
tokens representing natural assets like clean water, wild animal populations, or
biodiversity conservation – incentivizing regenerative practices and the responsible
stewardship of natural assets. Nature-based Currencies could also be backed by
a basket of bioregional eco-credits. Ongoing research on the application of active
inference233 in the design of Nature-based Currencies can inform prototypes by
bioregions. By integrating ecological indicators of health into monetary systems,
BFFs can enable a shift in theory of value within the bioregion and beyond. For more
information on digital Nature-based Currencies, we recommend reading Nature
Based Currencies: Integrating natural capital in advanced monetary systems, a
white paper by Open Earth Foundation.234

6.3 Local Market Networks and Bioregional
 Vouchers
While not necessarily a novel solution, Local Market Networks are potentially
powerful ways to resource bioregional transitions toward regenerative economies.

These networks are decentralized systems connecting producers, consumers,
and investors within a bioregion. Emphasizing local sourcing, production, and
consumption, the networks can take various forms, including farmers' markets,
Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs, online platforms for local goods,
and community-based cooperatives. Local Market Networks aim to strengthen
local economies, reduce environmental impact by minimizing transportation and
supporting regenerative practices, and foster community resilience by promoting
relationships between producers and consumers locally. They often prioritize
transparency, ethical sourcing, and community engagement over traditional market
dynamics such as competition.

Local Market Networks can also include innovative approaches like Bioregional
Community Voucher systems as a form of community currency.235 These systems
promote local economic resilience by circulating currency within the community,
facilitating transactions between residents and with local businesses. Unlike
conventional currency, these vouchers are tied to a specific bioregion, encouraging
value exchange within the bioregional economy and supporting bioregional
regeneration efforts. Such community currencies enable the two essential functions
of money (i.e. serving as a standard of value and facilitating exchange), promoting
quick circulation and discouraging its utilization as a store of value or a medium
for speculation. They foster a sense of community ownership and solidarity,
empowering residents to actively participate in shaping the future of their bioregion.
They can also be used to avoid the undesired financialisation of value flows.

6.4 Bioservices Banks
A Bioservices Bank236 is designed to integrate ecological services into the local
financial system by turning them into financial assets. By issuing bills of exchange
pegged against a stable currency and underwritten by third parties, the bank
monetizes ecological services, creating a self-sustaining engine for financing
ecological action. A Bioservices Bank operates by issuing notes equivalent to a
national currency, backed by the value of ecological services. These notes become
liquid in the market once the underwritten ecological services are matched with
liabilities or financed through various methods. This system effectively transforms
environmental conservation into a bankable service, creating a perpetual financing
mechanism.
A pivotal element of this concept is the integration of a system where landowners
and other actors can attribute their future rights to ecological services — for
example the carbon sequestration rights of their land to the bank. This process,
functioning similarly to assigning rights, allows these stakeholders to contribute
their future ecological assets to the bank. In exchange for this contribution, they
receive equity in the Bioservices Bank. This mechanism ensures that stakeholders
directly benefit from the bank's capitalization and investments made by the bank
or other agents in ecological projects. Thus, it creates a mutually beneficial
relationship, aligning the interests of individual landowners and other actors with the
broader goals of transitioning to regenerative bioregional economies.

A key feature of the proposed bank is its reliance on automation and transparent
governance. The verification of ecological services, transaction processes,
and banking operations would be fully automated, utilizing digital sensors and

transparent frameworks. This ensures efficiency, accountability, and public trust.
The governance structure is designed to avoid conflicts of interest. It suggests
an independent oversight mechanism, separate from the banking institution’s
administrative body. This is crucial for maintaining impartiality and enhancing
credibility.

6.5 Participatory grant-making through Quadratic Voting – A method

 next 20 years. During the gathering, blank posters around 9 key themes were placed
 around the venue and people collaborated in adding to and refining each of these.
 As a next step the trustees converted the posters into a 65 page strategic vision
 document for the bioregional trust.239 The document was well received by the local
 government and has been published on the local district council website, under
 Mohua 2042.
 Next, the trustees needed to decide how to carry out the execution of the strategy,
 and how to fund it. It was decided that the combination of purpose-owned companies,
 which exist for the benefit of the community and bioregion, would be supported along
 with a participatory grantmaking process – where anyone in the community could
 propose and vote on ideas. The Wellbeing Protocol team, a not-for-profit organization
 building technology-based infrastructure, was asked to set up a trial and developed
 an app that bioregional stakeholders could use for proposals and the voting process.
 To positively constrain the types of projects which could be approved, the strategic
 vision was adapted into a constitution; all of the projects proposed and approved
 needed to fit with the constitution and vision. Once initial funding was secured from
 the local Tasman District Council, a kickoff meeting for Mohua Wellbeing 2042 was
 organized.
 Launching the Trust
 During the kickoff, community members learned both how the app functioned, and
 shared the projects they believed were valuable in advancing the goals set out in the
 strategic vision document and constitution. They also learned about other potential
 local projects, and the members who were present voted on projects using the app.
 The Wellbeing Protocol team demonstrated that projects which receive a certain
 number of up-votes would be approved to move to the next stage through Quadratic
 Voting. By this method, rather than using 10 percent of their tokens to give one up-
 vote, a member could use 40 percent of their tokens for two up-votes or 90 percent of
 their tokens for three up-votes. This allowed community members to cast their votes
 according to how passionate they were about a project. The up-votes would also be
 buffered using the Conviction Voting approach, such that the full power of the vote
 only set in after the vote was not moved or changed to another option.
 Once a project receives enough up-votes from the community, the bioregional
 trustees – who are stewards within the app – can choose to move the project to
 the next phase but this is only possible if the project matches with the constitution,
 which is viewable by anyone within the app. Prior to moving the project to the next
 phase it is also reviewed in terms of its budget and feasibility, and stewards can make
 suggestions for changes to the project proposers during this time. The projects that
 make it to the final phase are then voted on again by the community. The amount of
 funding the project requires compared to the amount of money in the community
 funding pool determines the up-vote threshold the project must meet to be approved.
 Moving to implementation
 As of March 2024, four projects have progressed to the final proposal phase. Once a
 project is approved, the stewards work with the project lead to transfer the approved
 funding amount. As the project evolves, photos and videos related to the progress
 of the project are uploaded to the app for anyone in the community to view. In the
 first phase of funding, individual project costs ranged from NZD 200 to 1,000. The

239 Mohua 2042: Strategy Document

 next phase involves securing ongoing funding to top up this community funding pool,
 ideally by local government and local companies. Initial funding was sourced by the
 local government and a few leads have been established with companies that have
 verbally committed to allocating 10 percent of their profits to community projects that
 support bioregional wellbeing. One advantage of the rolling approach is that capital
 can be added as trust is built that the community can collectively propose, steward,
 and execute on valuable projects.
 The plan is also to help steward community-benefit companies that are steward-
 owned, i.e. owned by their purpose. These companies would be required to tithe
 10 percent of their profits to Mohua Wellbeing, and would receive help with their
 incubation from local community business advisors as well as receiving community or
 purpose oversight from the Mohua 2042 Bioregional Trust. Mohua 2042 is a charitable
 non-profit, and the trust deed allows trustees to serve in an oversight capacity for
 purpose-owned companies in an unpaid capacity.

6.6 Quadratic Funding and Equity Crowdfunding
as proxies for capital allocation
Crowdfunding is a financing instrument that allows ordinary citizens to participate
in funding projects that are subjectively important to them. In the special case of
equity crowd-funding, participating individuals gain shares of the funded project or
business in return for their money. Place-based Equity Crowdfunding thus allows
local stakeholders to participate in the success of the local regenerative economy,
and simultaneously weaves even stronger connections in this local economy. At
the same time, aggregated data from such place-based crowdfunding platforms
could help funders and investors who are not as immersed in the local context
to understand which projects locals consider worthy and promising. This helps
them to overcome knowledge gaps, and investment decisions can be made
more in alignment with what local people think best contributes to the Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy. This approach operates on the premise that locals know
best what is required for holistic regeneration, and where the likelihood of financial Quadratic Funding – By

projects in a bioregion. By surfacing tacit grassroots knowledge, place-based Equity a quadratic formula that

Quadratic Voting, incentivizes collaboration and fosters a sense of collective
ownership, ensuring that resources are allocated to projects with broad-based
support and high potential for long-term regenerative impact. Since 2019, Quadratic
Funding pioneer Gitcoin DAO has channeled over $60 million from 4.2 million
unique donations to fund open-source Web3 digital infrastructure and social and
ecological impact projects, including $3.9 million towards “climate solutions.” An
example of a funder leveraging Gitcoin for regeneration, is Ma Earth’s recent 2024
grant round, which supported regenerative land projects.

6.7 Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)
Another model for funding regenerative projects is the Retroactive Public Goods
Funding (RetroPGF) approach developed by the Optimism Collective. This model
is based on the idea that it is easier to agree on what was useful in the past than
what might be useful in the future. The approach aims to enable distributed but not
fully decentralized capital allocation to public goods242 projects (similar to Quadratic
Voting and Quadratic Funding). In the case of RetroPGF - which is initially focused
on funding software development - badge holders vote on projects and funding
is allocated based on the median score projects receive. Through this approach,
the community can select criteria for people with specialized expertise. These
specialists then do the necessary research and analysis to determine which
projects created the greatest community benefits. The RetroPGF structure provides
possible exit liquidity for public goods projects, which opens up a market for early
investment in those projects. In the case of RetroPGF, revenue from the use of open
source software funds that work retroactively. This approach to the governance
of capital allocation could support regenerative projects – particularly in areas like
ecological regeneration that also require a sufficient level of technical expertise,
whether Western or Indigenous, and where revenue is hard to capture directly at
the project level. One of the major challenges with this approach is that it requires
projects to have access to seed funding at the outset. Thus, it will likely not work well
in low-income communities.

6.8 Web3 flow funding and dynamic token
 issuance mechanisms for living, adaptive
 economies
Traditional grant models and discrete funding can put the focus on securing
operational funding, reducing the amount of time organizations spend on
performing mission-related work. For regenerative economies to flourish,
resource allocation must more closely resemble the living systems they aim to
mirror in information and economic systems. Flow funding has been identified as
an innovative mechanism for this purpose, and with blockchain and novel digital
currency issuance mechanisms, funding flows can be automated, integrated, and
expressed as highly adaptive economies that can contract and expand based on
needs and value creation in the network.

242 In this book, we primarily refer to public goods as ‘common assets.’

One such mechanism making use of flow funding – bonding curves – holds
great potential for the implementation of BFFs. Bonding curves243 are a new tool
in the Web3 space that tie two or more elements of a system together through
mathematical relationships encoded into smart contracts. They provide an
economic invariant between the supply of tokens and the reserve assets backing
their value, making token price deterministic and providing guaranteed liquidity for
tokens. Adjusting the circulating supply based on demand dampens the volatility
and couples with the demand for the token’s utility. Bonding curves and primary
market token issuance lay the economic foundations for new tools that can
address some of the major challenges of distributed economic systems, such as
bootstrapping small economies, providing necessary exchange liquidity, facilitating
demand-responsive dynamic token supply, and continuous fundraising. Bonding
curves have also been ‘augmented’ with the addition of common pool treasuries or
even prediction markets, to improve the collective signaling capacity of these new
tools for social and ecosystemic benefit.

6.9 Place-based Bioregional Tithing, voluntary
 taxation, and Business Improvement Districts
Bioregional Tithing, voluntary taxation, or taxation-like initiatives, such as Business
Improvement Districts (BIDs) offer a promising avenue for financing bioregional
regeneration. BIDs provide a defined area within which businesses elect to pay an
additional fee in order to fund projects within the district's boundaries. By harnessing
the collective financial contributions of businesses, property owners, and residents
within a specific geographic area, BIDs can generate a dedicated pool of funds to
support initiatives that aim to support regeneration and achieve what is set out in the
Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Voluntary taxation mechanisms like BIDs provide
a means for stakeholders, including organizations and individuals, to directly invest
in the health and resilience of their local ecosystems, fostering a sense of ownership
and responsibility within the community. Additionally, they enable collaborative
partnerships between public and private entities, leveraging resources and
expertise from both sectors to drive meaningful ecological improvements at the
bioregional level. Combined with participatory budgeting (such as outlined in
Section 6.5) Bioregional Tithing can help communities mobilize financial resources
in alignment with their shared values and priorities. One inspiring precedent at the
bioregional scale is the Shuumi Land Tax on Ohlone territory in the East Bay of San
Francisco.

6.10 Advance Market Commitments
 for bioregional regeneration
Similar to offtake agreements, Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) constitute
a promise to purchase or financially support a product upon its successful
development. Governments and private foundations commonly offer AMCs to
incentivize the creation of vaccines or treatments. In return, pharmaceutical
companies agree to supply a specified quantity of doses at a predetermined price.

243 Jeff Emmett et al.: Exploring Bonding Curves: Differentiating Primary and Secondary Automated Market Makers

This funding approach is employed when the expenses associated with research
and development are deemed prohibitive for the private sector without assurance
of a minimum volume of sales. In the space of bioregional regeneration, AMCs can
be used as investment funds committing financial capital to projects that promise
future ecological value and regenerative asset creation, but are risky or expensive
to initiate. Using this tool, financial resources would be guaranteed to ventures, for
example regenerative food startups, that meet certain ecological impact criteria,
providing a stable market for their future development.

6.11 Profit Pooling and whole economy health
 as triggers for investor returns
Building resilient bioregional economies relies on a strong connectivity between
local businesses. In these economies, the financial health of one organization is
inextricably interlinked with that of others and with the whole ecosystem – much
like in the web of life in biology. With a Profit Pooling agreement, participating
businesses agree to contribute a defined fair and equal percentage of their
monthly or annual profits to a common insurance pool. This pooling of excess profit
ensures that if any participating business faces cashflow or profitability issues
due to external and uncontrollable circumstances, it can access funds to stabilize
its operations. Profit Pooling has long been utilized in large global corporations
to ensure healthy support between their various subsidiaries; its implementation
within local economies could yield profound benefits that are currently untapped. By
bolstering the resilience of individual businesses, Profit Pooling cultivates resilient
or even anti-fragile enterprise ecosystems, fortifying the fabric of local economies Anti-fragile – The quality of a

6.12 Obligation Clearing (also known as
 netting) and Mutual Credit as a liquidity-
 saving mechanism
The practice of debt clearing is centuries old, with origins in 14th century
Italian banking practices. Now, its resurgence using Web3 technologies and
interdisciplinary research that integrates graph and monetary theory offers new
possibilities in leveraging payment graphs and cycles (second order dynamics)
rather than money itself.245 The basic concept is to create greater economic
efficiency and reduce the need for liquidity by clearing debts within a network,
where participant’s obligations cancel each other out without money or a

single token changing hands. Paired with Mutual Credit in the form of loans on
complementary currency backed by future production, these clearing loops can
save businesses up to 50 percent of their need for cash to settle those debts. This
could offer BFFs and corollary organizations significant savings in operating costs
and provide shelter in high interest rate environments.246

The case studies in this chapter tell diverse stories about how dedicated social
processes are combined with thoughtful technological innovations to create strong
foundations for BFFs. While each story is substantial as a standalone case study,
their real power is found in the synergies between them, and how these linkages
give rise to cascading benefits in the bioregions served by these projects and
organizations. In these examples, Regenerate Cascadia (Case Study 9) emerged
from the Inaugural Edge Prize (Case Study 8), which used Hylo (Case Study 10)
as a platform for convening leaders to consider potential beneficiaries. As a set of
independent but interlocking narratives they represent a powerful collective case
study in how creative efforts across bioregions are resourcing each other and
amplifying the global movement.

 The Edge Prize – Scaling What’s Possible by
 Supporting and Connecting Regenerative
 Innovators
 By: Edward West

 About the Edge Prize
 The Edge Prize, represents a new methodology for growing a bioregional community
 by hosting a distributed online accelerator and prize challenge. The goals of The Edge
 Prize methodology are to:
 — Convene a group of extraordinary entrepreneurs, leaders, and innovators
 throughout a bioregion working on regenerative projects that benefit the lands,
 waters, and people of the bioregion — “The Edgewalkers.”
 — Invite them into a supportive community of reciprocity, mentorship, workshops,
 and collaboration.
 — Amplify their stories, in order to bring resources, collaboration, partnerships, and
 inspire others to start their own regenerative initiatives — in their bioregion and
 beyond.
 — Build from these stories a public-facing library of “what’s working” to help scale
 and accelerate regenerative practices worldwide.
 Benefiting communities and ecosystems
 The inaugural Edge Prize, piloted in Salmon Nation in 2023, was created by Applied
 Alchemy and the Terran Collective, and sponsored by Salmon Nation Trust and
 the Magic Canoe. The 2023 Edge Prize invited individuals and organizations doing
 something that benefits their community and surrounding ecosystems, offering
 dozens of cash prizes, ranging from $500 to $20,000. Individuals and organizations
 stewarding projects in areas as diverse as Food and Agriculture, Health, Culture and
 Education, Water, Energy, Community Finance and Development, Water, Ecosystem
 Restoration, or Governance sectors were invited to apply, attracting a diverse and
 accomplished collection of 130 leaders and entrepreneurs throughout Salmon Nation.
 Overall, USD 80,000 were distributed to deserving impactful projects in Salmon
 Nation bioregion, with USD 60,000 of that allocated by the community themselves in
 a participatory funding process that supported all participating Edgewalkers to get to
 know each other’s work.
 All applicants were invited to create a brief written description of their work, as
 well as a short video describing their work. These formed the basis of a public
 open-source library of bioregional solutions. Applicants, along with subject matter
 experts, voted to allocate the prize money to the most compelling applicants.
 Applicants were also invited into an online community, encouraged to discover and
 learn about each other’s work, and were given access to capacity-building support
 from mentors and subject-matter experts. The overall structure and format of the
 Edge Prize encouraged Edgewalkers to collaborate with each other, and numerous
 self-organizing partnerships emerged during the program. In one example, two
 Edgewalkers partnered with each other to convene the first Edge Prize-inspired event
 series and movement building strategy: Regenerate Cascadia.
