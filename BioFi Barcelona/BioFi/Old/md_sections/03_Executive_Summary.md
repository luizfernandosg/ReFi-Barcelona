BFFs do this by working hand in hand with the Bioregional Organizing Team and
Bioregional Hub to enable the decentralization of financial resource governance,
the design of synergistic project portfolios, and the transition to a regenerative
economy. Whereas Bioregional Hubs work to bring together and empower a
bioregional regeneration network by facilitating regenerative flow of all capital
types, BFFs focus specifically – but not exclusively – on facilitating the regenerative
flow of financial capital. Together, the Bioregional Organizing Team, Bioregional Hub,
and BFFs form the three legs of a stool that supports bioregional regeneration.9

rather than more, dependent on both financial capital overall and financial capital
from outside the region, and where financial flows better align with real flows of
value. BFFs will work on creating regenerative flows at multiple levels – at the
level of organizations it invests in, and at various levels in nested systems. This
includes supporting regenerative organizations in the bioregion with technical
assistance, and the development of the enabling environment conditions needed
for regenerative organizations to succeed; deepening and expanding markets
for regenerative activities; creating regenerating pools of funding to support
management of common assets; raising the right type of investment capital;

subsidies, and the issuance of Bioregional Regeneration Bonds.

as an evolution of impact investing. They seek to establish a financial architecture
that recognizes the complexity inherent to systemic transformation, and the
fundamental interconnectedness of interventions. They help to build synergistic
and systemic investment portfolios, creating positive spillover values which enable
mutually reinforcing and positive feedback loops of systemic value generation
across projects.

BFFs provide a pathway for even multinational corporations – that often seem to
operate everywhere and nowhere at the same time – to come back into relationship
with the very real places and people they are dependent on and are in turn
impacting. BFFs enable them to move towards healing and reciprocity through how
they invest.

-> 5. BFF Governance and Capital Allocation
The governance structure of BFFs underpins their ability to both decentralize
financial resource governance and catalyze the transition to a regenerative
economy. As BFFs represent an intentional attempt to encode an institution with
worldviews, values, logic, and context that are fundamentally distinct from those of

existing financial institutions, governance will be a challenging area requiring great
care and collective experimentation. The assumptions and habits of governance
learned through participation in traditional institutions may not serve BFFs, and both
intra- and interpersonal friction in the learning process will likely emerge. It is critical
for BFFs to cultivate a healthy unlearning/learning culture where they can carefully
consider and experiment with what values are encoded in their governance, who
participates, and what frameworks, processes, and tools are applied.

At the highest level, we encourage BFFs to implement an inclusive, participatory
governance structure that represents the bioregion and is built upon a solid
relational foundation of trust. BFFs governance design does not emerge from
a vacuum, but rather from the rich context of the learnings and relationships
built throughout bioregional organizing efforts and the creation of a Bioregional
Regeneration Strategy, which can clarify specific, place-based understandings of
the values that are to be upheld governance. In particular, we recommend careful
consideration of the “R Values” that many Indigenous communities center in their
governance (Section 4.1).11 We offer many proven and emergent frameworks,
processes, and tools that can support BFFs in both governance design and practice.

Finally, we encourage BFFs to explicitly design their governance towards three
key aims: shift power imbalances, work with existing authorities, and build right
relationship with other BFFs across regions and scales. This is hard, messy
work with no easy answers that fit all contexts. However, we trust that through
experiments in creating BFFs around the world, the collective intelligence of place
can be harnessed to inform and support an entire network of BFFs – allowing
common patterns of trustworthy governance structures to emerge.

-> 6. Innovative Mechanisms for Financing Bioregional
Regeneration
A series of innovative financial tools and approaches is emerging that can help to
capitalize BFFs and support the transition of a bioregional economy. Some worth
mentioning include:

— Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Web3-based eco-credits
— (Digital) Nature-based Currencies
— Local Market Networks & Bioregional Vouchers
— Bioservices Banks
— Participatory grant-making through quadratic and Conviction Voting
— Quadratic Funding and Equity Crowdfunding as proxies for capital allocation
— Place-based Bioregional Tithing, voluntary taxation, and Business Improvement
 Districts
— Advance Market Commitments for bioregional regeneration
— Profit Pooling and whole-economy health as triggers for investor returns

Many of the themes explored in this book are aligned with the values and patterns
driving the decentralized finance or “DeFi” movement. The authors believe that the
potential of existing protocols, tools, technologies, and templates in the Web3 space
to bolster the bioregional movement and supercharge grassroots regeneration, has
– as yet – not been realized.

11 For example: relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence, regeneration, redistribution, and
 reconnection

-> 7. Additional Case Studies: Stories of Bioregional
Organizing and Bioregional Finance in Action
In addition to the multiple case studies throughout this book, five more case
studies are presented in the annex. Each of the case studies tells diverse stories of
combining dedicated social processes and thoughtful technological innovations to
create strong foundations for BFFs. While each is substantial as a standalone case
study, they represent, as a set of interdependent stories, a collective case study in
how creative efforts across bioregions are resourcing each other and the global
movement.

-> 8. Next Steps and Call to Action
A series of recommendations and calls to action are presented for important
stakeholder groups: Bioregional Organizers; Regenerators and Indigenous
Communities, Nations, and Tribes; Investors; Philanthropists; Policymakers;
Multilaterals and Development Agencies; Innovators and Futurists; Designers;
Economists; and Financial Services Consultants. While many of these actions may
on the surface look like to-do list items to check off, we suggest that they are all –
including the most technocratic and technical – actually suggestions for forming
and nurturing relationships of care, trust, healing, reciprocity, clear communication,
and mutual learning.

Most of these recommended actions are not merely speculative. They have
been sourced from a diverse set of active practitioners around the world. Thus,
our list may also be seen as a celebration of the strength and maturity of existing
bioregional organizing, coordination, and financing efforts. And yet, there is still
much to do, and innovation to pursue, for this movement to cohere, and for BFFs
to be established as effective, trustworthy institutions.
The recommended actions should not be understood as prescriptive or linear. Not

all actions will look the same, or be needed across all contexts, and they do not
need to follow an ordered sequence from first to last. We understand bioregional
regeneration is a complex, dynamic flow of actions and relations across multiple
nested scales within a landscape and our global networks, and we see these
actions as supporting that process.

Finally, we encourage you to consider that by reading this book, you are already an
active – even essential – participant in this movement, whether or not you resonate
with everything written or identify as a key stakeholder. We encourage you to hold
your professional or place-based identities lightly, and approach this book with
curiosity towards the relationships and actions — listed and unlisted — that feel
most compelling to you. Perhaps look up from the screen or the page every once in
a while — you may be surprised by what is available right now, in your place.

-> 9. Conclusion
destructive economic system and grow new, regenerative, bioregional economies
that can autonomously engage in economic reciprocity with their neighbors. Our
financial architecture must serve this recognition. There is an order to the changes
now emerging from the disorder of our current social and economic systems:
capital is finding its way to flow back to life and the humans stewarding it.
