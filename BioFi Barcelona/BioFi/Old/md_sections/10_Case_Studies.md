-> 7. Additional Case Studies: Stories of Bioregional
Organizing and Bioregional Finance in Action
In addition to the multiple case studies throughout this book, five more case
studies are presented in the annex. Each of the case studies tells diverse stories of
combining dedicated social processes and thoughtful technological innovations to
create strong foundations for BFFs. While each is substantial as a standalone case
study, they represent, as a set of interdependent stories, a collective case study in
how creative efforts across bioregions are resourcing each other and the global
movement.

 The Edge Prize concept is a template for a broader, open-source movement to
 catalyze critical regenerative innovation in bioregions globally, fitting into a template
 of bioregional transformation on an evolutionary trajectory toward regenerative
 innovation.

 CASE STUDY 9:
 Regenerate Cascadia – Coordinated and Coherent
 Bioregional Organizing
 By: Taya Seidler, Clare Attwell, Brandon Letsinger, and Sheri Herndon

 About Regenerate Cascadia
 Regenerate Cascadia is a capacity-building organization and a social movement and
 developing a vision and framework to administer a regeneration fund for Cascadia,
 a bioregion located along the upper Pacific Rim of North America stretching from
 Southeast Alaska to Northern California, and as far east as the Yellowstone Caldera.
 A central goal of Regenerate Cascadia is to grow capacity cohesively across the
 scales of landscapes, ecoregions, and bioregions – something that currently does
 not exist locally or globally – as part of a multi-generational strategy for the long-term
 health of the Cascadia bioregion. Regenerate Cascadia is addressing the complex
 challenges in funding connected landscape outcomes across a bioregion through a
 whole-systems approach that: prioritizes the central role of place-based stewardship;
 ensures decision-making is held by those at the local level; develops trust-based
 networks that hold the integrity of the work; and uses a nested scale structure to
 facilitate information flow, representation, and learning across the whole system.
 Activating a bioregional movement
 Regenerate Cascadia was formed by Brandon Letsinger and Clare Attwell in April
 2023 during the first ever Salmon Nation Edge Prize, where their vision to activate
 a bioregional movement in Cascadia won the Edge Prize for Innovation in Systems
 and Governance. After months of planning with 100+ local community organizers
 on both sides of the Canada-US border, they partnered with the Design School
 for Regenerating Earth to co-facilitate a month-long Bioregional Activation Tour.
 They traveled to 14 communities around Cascadia during October 2023, hosting
 presentations that asked, “How do we regenerate the Cascadia bioregion?”. They
 met with more than 1000 individuals, including Indigenous knowledge keepers,
 regenerative leaders, groups, community artists, and elders across Oregon,
 Washington, and British Columbia through presentations, workshops, site visits,
 and strategy sessions. This was followed by an online summit that brought together
 50+ presentations in a ‘Festival of What Works’, and concluded with an Open
 Space Unconference from November 3-12, 2023, where participants cocreated
 working groups for Regenerate Cascadia. The vision resonated strongly with many
 communities across the bioregion. Jay Bowen, an elder of the Skagit people who
 opened the Summit, articulated the following statement in the opening ceremony:
 “Gathered before us are the most important people in the world. It may be a small
 group right now, but in a few short years, there's going to be a long line of people
 waiting to get involved in this very important movement that is overseeing the welfare
 of our communities.”

 Beyond this, Regenerate Cascadia has succeeded in meeting the core challenge
 participatory events often struggle with – maintaining momentum and continuous
 engagement among participants. They have an active Telegram channel of 121
 members sharing thousands of messages through 39 subchannels covering specific
 topics and guilds, organizational infrastructure discussions, local communities’
 individual channels, media and communication, inter alia. The community is thriving
 and members are actively engaging with each other. The Regenerate Cascadia
 community of ‘regenerators’ has since co-developed a digital platform to support the
 work; they continue to collaboratively take in feedback and refine this prototype as
 their ideas and needs evolve.
 A digital landscape
 The digital platform includes a structural framework (see Figure 11.) that prioritizes
 community-led work within a landscape, while thoughtfully aggregating place-
 based projects into larger coordination structures. A ‘front door’ website is an easy
 entry point for people to learn more, join as a member, donate to specific projects,
 and get more involved. Projects and communities each have a landing page that
 serve as a focal point for local news, resources, and events. These are curated by
 participating communities and are indexable by search engines. The digital platform
 provides an online space to connect within a landscape and across watersheds at
 the nested scales of ecoregions and the Cascadia bioregion. The platform includes
 a comprehensive ‘back end’ suite of tools and resources to support local project
 work, including (i) education and onboarding; (ii) an information commons and
 searchable directories; (iii) a regenerative movement map and relational database;
 and (iv) comprehensive data, measurement, evaluation and reporting capabilities.
 All Regenerate Cascadia programs are part of an integrated 501(c)3 nonprofit
 administrative backend to provide accounting, receive grants, raise funds, deliver
 timely financial reporting, and maintain legal compliance.

 Figure 11. Regenerate Cascadia’s evolving structural framework for supporting
 bioregional funding

 Regenerate Cascadia’s living structural framework can be viewed as a system for the
 coherent flow of resources - educational, financial, inspirational, and cultural - that
 supports ongoing bioregional regeneration outcomes and learning. The framework
 enables capital to be distributed from a large bioregional fund into smaller landscape-
 level funds that deliver resources to decentralized projects according to the needs of
 ecoregions and landscapes. This ensures governance power is held by those closest
 to the work through trust-based networks of relationships that connect and align
 diverse projects within a landscape-level vision and strategy. The framework provides
 a comprehensive intermediary between local communities and funders. This enables
 effective cooperation, coordination, and governance across the bioregion to optimize
 strategic outcomes.
 Representing diversity
 A key tenet of the framework is the commitment to the representation of diverse
 voices at all scales, including those of ecosystems and keystone species, ensuring
 that feedback loops from across the whole system enable collective intelligence to
 inform future actions. This supports the whole system to see itself (co-sense), learn
 (co-presence), and iterate (co-create), enabling connected and concurrent local
 and bioregional agency to solve problems at the appropriate scales. Regenerate
 Cascadia’s structures are built with one of the movement’s core goals in mind –
 to prototype a series of replicable transformational templates that return ‘right
 relationship’ to the Earth as a central organizing premise for finance, while evolving
 how we live and work together cooperatively across scales.
 A core foundation of Regenerate Cascadia are ‘Regenerate Hubs’, which hold the
 governance capacity to manage a fund for a discrete landscape across diverse
 stakeholders. Regenerate Hubs operate in several ways, including:
 — working with local communities and weaving relationships to develop a long-term
 vision aligned with the overall bioregional vision of Regenerate Cascadia;
 — identifying and engaging voices that need to be present;
 — maintaining a portfolio of regenerative projects within their defined landscape
 areas;
 — stewarding an annual landscape budget; and
 — maintaining team coherence.
 Structured for regeneration
 Each Hub has a core team that facilitates/helps establish conditions for cooperation
 and trust and is accountable for administrative and reporting requirements. Each
 landscape features Bioregional Learning Centers that facilitate the cocreation of
 place-based frameworks and serve as foundational education spaces for sense-
 making and decision-making in the community. These centers monitor, evaluate, and
 manage the dynamic flow of an information commons using shared metrics for social,
 cultural, and ecological impact that supports robust fund reporting and continuous
 learning. Hubs primarily collaborate with members of Regenerate Cascadia from
 within a particular landscape, and are represented by a network of Ecoregional
 Councils – governance bodies responsible for creating ecoregional budgets that
 maintain the connections between local and bioregional scales.
 Regenerate Cascadia’s structural framework serves several other core functions in
 supporting landscape leaders, including bioregional ‘Guilds’ made up of knowledge
 communities responsible for providing tools and resources around specific

 regenerative topics, and connecting learning and networks across landscapes.
 Hubs and Guilds undertake their own projects and activities while sharing news,
 updates, resources, directories, and events for a specific place or topic in a way that
 is meaningful for all participants. Regenerate Cascadia supports the Hubs and Guilds’
 core teams and services by administering a portion of all funds raised; providing
 opportunities to practice healthy budgeting and governance with small sums of
 money; and growing their decision-making and governance capacities ahead of
 receiving larger flow funding. Finally, the non-profit backbone of Regenerate Cascadia
 is maintained through ‘Bioregional Stewardship Councils’, which directly assist with
 communications, outreach, fundraising, finance, legal, and reporting requirements,
 and a Bioregional Congress – an assembly comprised of Guilds and Ecoregional
 Councils to govern a shared Cascadia bioregional vision.
 Each of the structural components Regenerate Cascadia is collaboratively building
 are demonstrable templates that are adaptable, replicable, and scalable in other
 localities. They are significant, not only for a single bioregion, but as a living framework
 for movements emerging around the world. By connecting and resourcing those
 doing the work in their communities through the support of core backbone teams of
 bioregional weavers; providing knowledge and resource sharing through Guilds that
 weave between landscapes; and co-creating the digital infrastructure for coordination
 and communication, Regenerate Cascadia enables coordinated, coherent processes
 for bioregional learning and regeneration. This framework provides a governance
 model for bioregional funding, enabling capital to flow to where it is needed on the
 ground, and building the foundations for funding the transition to a regenerative
 economy.

 CASE STUDY 10:
 Hylo – A Coordination Platform for the Future of
 Bioregional Organizing
 By: Clare Politano

 About Hylo
 Hylo is a community-led, open-source coordination tool for purpose-driven groups,
 with an emphasis on place-based organizing. The free web and mobile apps allow
 community members to deepen relationships and collaborate to get things done
 through discussions, requests, offers, resources, projects, events, geographic maps,
 direct messaging, and chat. All of this is offered without advertising or data-harvesting
 in a clean and simple user interface.
 Hylo is for place-based organizing
 Giving groups tools for local coordination is a particular focus for Hylo, because
 ecological regeneration and community care must happen in a place-based context.
 By using the geographic map, members can share and discover local events,
 resources, and collaborators. Groups can also define their geographic boundary and
 display that on the shared map, which also includes a layer for Native territories that
 can be toggled on and off. Hylo plans to add bioregions as the next map layer.
 Bioregional coordination is already happening on Hylo
 Several bioregions are using Hylo to support connection in their local landscape.

 In 2023, Salmon Nation bioregion used Hylo to convene a community of local leaders,
 the “Edgewalkers,” throughout Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and
 northern California for an initiative called the Edge Prize. The group gathered on
 Hylo for a series of online relationship-building and educational sessions, and many
 participants also met up in-person and made new local connections. The Edge Prize
 culminated in the Edgewalkers distributing $80,000 in prize money to deserving
 bioregional projects through a participatory budgeting process. The Edgewalkers
 used a different tech tool to conduct the co-budgeting exercise, and in the future this
 function will be built into Hylo.
 After the convening, two Edge Prize participants founded a new bioregional group
 together, Regenerate Cascadia, which went on to organize an in-person bioregional
 activation tour, in-person event series, and online summit all dedicated to ecological
 regeneration and community resilience in Cascadia bioregion. This group remains
 very active on the ground in Cascadia bioregion.
 Other bioregional groups using Hylo include the Bay Area Bioregion, Salish Sea,
 Sacramento River, Appalachia, Thames River Watershed, and Bioregional Weaving
 Labs. People use these groups to share local opportunities and information, meet
 collaborators, and coordinate action - like civic participation in public comments
 related to local environmental policy, or crowdfunding to support the return of land
 to Indigenous tribes. There is also a global community of practice, the Bioregional
 Commons, where place-based organizers from around the world are connecting
 to share and discuss resources relevant to bioregionalism and the transition to
 regenerative bioregional economies.
 Tools for bioregional self-governance
 Through a partnership with OpenTEAM, the Open Technology Ecosystem for
 Agricultural Management, Hylo is building tools to support the transition to
 regenerative agriculture and the participatory governance of purpose-driven,
 collaborative groups. These prosocial tools include space for groups to share their
 purpose and agreements, and prompt members to commit to them; administrative
 tools to curate and assign roles and responsibilities within the group; and coming
 soon, tools for proposals and decision-making. OpenTEAM is using these tools
 to manage collaboration among dozens of sub-awardees - networks of farmers
 and open-source technologists - working together to fulfill a $35M grant to the
 organization from the USDA to support the growth of climate-smart agriculture in the US.
 Combined with Hylo’s mapping features, these tools to support place-based
 collaboration and governance give bioregional groups the power to steward their
 landscape as a commons. This might, for example, mean the residents of a bioregion
 making proposals for restoration projects or local regenerative businesses, with other
 residents voting on which proposals to support and how to allocate resources among
 them. These tools can be powerful enablers of capital allocation for Bioregional
 Financing Facilities.
 Bioregional DAOs
 Hylo is stewarded by Terran Collective, a bioregional group in the California Bay
 Area whose purpose is to amplify collaboration among people regenerating
 communities and the planet. Terran’s vision is for bioregional groups on Hylo to grow
 strong collaborative cultures and mature into bioregional DAOs – Decentralized
 Autonomous Organizations (see Section 4.7). A DAO is a collaborative organization
 where members decide together how to govern a shared resource or a commons.

 The aim of such a DAO would be to steward the wellbeing of the land and the people,
 with members participating in governance decisions to support this care. Decisions
 could enable the creation of land management agreements, the transition to local
 production and circular economies, advancement of ecological regeneration, and
 improvements in community resilience and climate adaptation.

 CASE STUDY 11:
 ReCommon – Regenerative Common Land Trusts
 By: Alex Corren

 About ReCommon
 ReCommon is a US-based organization dedicated to building systems for
 regenerative community land acquisition and governance, using an adaptive
 bioregional framework.
 ReCommon approaches this work on the “pattern-level” to create innovative yet
 grounded solutions that reflect foundational principles in nature. This approach
 is based on the understanding that there are common patterns present in most
 successful solutions, and that identifying and making those patterns accessible to
 others can greatly streamline place-based, on-the-ground action.
 This work includes building governance protocols and legal templates that are
 designed to scale based upon natural patterns, such as land use patterns, community
 design patterns, and regenerative landscape intervention patterns. The groups
 that ReCommon works with then move from the pattern-level to the detail-level
 by adapting these protocols and templates to their place-based projects and
 communities – rendering them increasingly decentralized and interoperable, which
 cultivates systemic resilience.
 Hybrid entity structure
 ReCommon’s hybrid entity structure serves as an integrated bridge between impact
 investment capital and long-term regenerative stewardship of land in Trust by place-
 based bioregional communities. There are three core sister entities are:
 ReCommon Foundation - 501(c)3 nonprofit, cultivating Bioregional Nodes,
 governance and stewardship of land in Trust
 ReCommon Trust - impact investment trust fund, acquires land to be stewarded and
 governed by Bioregional Nodes and other aligned entities
 ReCommon Labs - cooperative that builds digital tools to support the coordination,
 acquisition, and governance of land held in Trust
 These diverse entity structures are able to work closely together towards a common
 goal while leveraging all pathways of capital formation. The Foundation accepts tax-
 exempt donations of all kinds and applies for grant funding, the Trust issues shares
 to investors for the acquisition of land from investors, and Labs accepts a blend of
 investor and non-investor members to build the ReCommon ecosystem.

 Adaptive bioregional governance
 ReCommon’s place-based governance framework is called the Regenerative
 Community Land Trust (aka RCLT, RegenCLT), which builds upon core principles and
 functionality of the classic CLT model while expanding on it with ecological design
 principles codified into bylaws, leaseholds, and other documents. This model of
 land tenure serves as the foundation for how the land is managed, accessed, and
 stewarded by the community.
 The distinct governance bodies that are responsible for the long-term stewardship
 of land in trust correspond to ecoregions and are called Bioregional Nodes. They
 oversee the agreements for use of the land, manage the Bioregional Node Treasury,
 and submit proposals related to use of funds, and use of land.
 Land is held in Trust and is governed by Bioregional Nodes. Leaseholders access the
 land via long-term renewable leaseholds, and have direct ownership in the structures,
 businesses and activities that happen on the land. Each Node has five key stakeholder
 categories. Each category has equal weight – 20 percent – regardless of the number
 of members
 — Stewards: leaseholders with direct stewardship responsibility for land in Trust
 — Elders: members that represent rights of nature and Indigenous wisdom
 — Patrons: Commons Credit holders, investors into land held in Trust
 — Partners: aligned organizations that are working in and/or with the Node
 — General Members: members located in the Node, with no other qualifiers
 This structure allows for larger and smaller coordination bodies to form organically,
 honoring the complexity of relationships within and across landscapes and cultures.
 Securing land for the bioregional commons
 ReCommon Trust raises capital to build a distributed bioregional network of land
 holdings through the issuance of shares known as Commons Credits. CCs directly
 correlate to property acquired by the Trust, and are backed by the value of the land.
 Patrons – the owners of CCs – have a seat at the table in RCLT governance in the
 Bioregional Node that contains the property.
 Governance of the land held in Trust is explicitly delegated to stewardship entities.
 Bioregional Nodes, via ReCommon Foundation, are the default stewardship entity,
 but the Trust has the flexibility to work with any place-based organization that exists
 specifically to support the multi-generational care of land.
 The Foundation is a significant shareholder in the Trust, which means that when
 profits are generated – by scalable leasehold fees, etc. – and are distributed to
 shareholders, the Bioregional Node Treasuries are direct recipients of a portion of
 those profits. This serves as the foundation of a regenerative flywheel for resilient
 bioregional economies, where land in Trust generates revenue that is redistributed to
 the community for ongoing support of ecological bioregional initiatives.

 Regenerosity – Flowing Capital to Grassroots
 Regeneration by Cultivating Trust
 By: Faith Flanigan and Ruth Andrade

 About Regenerosity
 For over 15 years, the Buckminster Fuller Institute, Lush Spring Prize, and UNDP’s
 Equator Prize have identified, spotlighted, and funded more than 400 leading and
 upcoming grassroots organizations in the regenerative movement that are delivering
 programs at the nexus of climate, ecology, livelihoods, and sovereignty. Regenerosity
 emerged in 2019 as a collaborative between these prize programs designed to
 bolster the critical role philanthropy has to play during these challenging times by
 leveraging this track-record and experience. Regenerosity works to continually grow
 partnerships, flow resources, and facilitate learning for regenerative grassroots
 organizations.
 To achieve this, Regenerosity thinks systemically. From the understanding that
 regeneration is about creating more capacity and capability to create conditions
 conducive to life, Regenerosity supports a developmental culture throughout all the
 elements of our theory of change by:
 — Supporting grassroots, community-led organizations in threatened or degraded
 landscapes through capacity development grants, and by inviting members of
 the communities Regenerosity works with to design participatory trust-based
 programs according to their needs.
 — Bringing grantee organizations together in regional peer-to-peer learning circles
 and supporting their connection to other networks and funders.
 — Bolstering the critical role of philanthropy by engaging funders in the concepts of
 trust-based and regenerative philanthropy, providing experiences of connection
 to nature (in partnership with Be the Earth Foundation), and attracting further
 funding for grassroots organizations in ways that are more trust-based.
 — Creating and promoting grassroots-led stories to share the impact and inspire the
 larger movement.
 — Developing Regenerosity into an organization that embodies those principles in
 governance and creates opportunities for its own growth.
 Regenerosity’s vision is a world where the power of gifting and collaboration can
 nurture thriving communities and grassroots initiatives as they steward ecosystems
 towards vibrant health.
 Regenerosity’s theory of change
 Regenerosity works across scales through all of their programs. They weave action-
 focused collaboration between grassroots organizations, funders, and key actors to
 develop human capacity to be in right relationship with all living systems by centering:
 — Place-based Impact: Co-designing catalytic programs with grassroots
 organizations based on long-term relationships of trust. Flowing capital and
 resources to these organizations so they can grow their impact and potential to
 become regional hubs of regenerative practice.
 — Network Collaboration: Bringing organizations together through regional

 communities of peers. Organizations join learning circles in and across cohorts
 for peer-to-peer learning, storytelling, and strategy development.
 — Movement Building: Spotlighting evidence and grassroots-led stories that inspire
 the larger movement. Engaging with funders and key actors to influence the field
 of regenerative philanthropy and further attract interest and resources for the
 growth of the grassroots regenerative movement.
 Regenerosity’s core programs
 Regenerosity’s core programs are based on shifting the power dynamics of
 philanthropy, catalyzing the work of their partners, and deeply listening and sharing
 their stories.
 Seeds Flow Funds
 The Seed Flow Funds are an experiment in trust-based philanthropy that puts the
 design (and direction) of the fund and decision-making about how the money gets
 spent in the hands of community leaders. The two current funds support “Indigenous
 Women in Brazil” and “East African Youth & Women in Permaculture”.
 In each of these funds, $3,000 is distributed to individuals and groups to lead changes
 in their communities. So far, 13 indigenous women in 12 states across Brazil and 12
 mostly women permaculturists across 3 regions in Uganda and Kenya have delivered
 a diverse array of unique, context-dependent community initiatives. Currently 16 more
 women in Brazil are participating in the second cycle.
 Blossom, capacity strengthening program
 Blossom is a two-year program co-designed with grassroots partners who are
 working to regenerate threatened or degraded landscapes at the intersection of food
 sovereignty, livelihoods, and ecology. Through deploying participatory capital via a
 co-design process, Regenerosity is able to support their grassroots partners’ growth
 and innovation.
 The program develops partners’ organizational capacity, leadership skills, and
 connections, and supports their prototyping of models so that local organizations
 can grow into thriving regional hubs. The 2021-2023 cohort enabled thousands of
 members of Indigenous and local communities to increase food security and secure
 sustainable incomes while protecting and regenerating their traditional lands;
 scaling regionally and/or nationally while partnering with government offices and
 large NGOs; and scaling their programs through additional funding received through
 Regenerosity’s support.
 Regenerosity has delivered over $1M USD to 11 projects over 2.5 years, including
 supporting:
 — 2,500 direct beneficiaries who saw a 76% increase in household income with
 partners YICE Uganda and KAFRED in Bigodi National Park
 — a 100% increase in daily household meals in Nakivale Refugee camp with the
 participants of the food program with YICE Uganda
 — a 30% increase in water availability for biodiversity and livelihoods through Tarun
 Bharat Sangh across 5 watersheds in India.
 Pollinate storytelling series
 Liberation Agriculture is a film series exploring what true regeneration cultivates. Far
 too often, narratives around regeneration only go soil deep. With the intersections

 of ecological collapse and systemic oppression becoming increasingly clear,
 Regenerosity is sharing stories that interweave the struggle to reclaim ecosystemic
 health and the struggle for collective liberation.
 Nurture Funder Community of Practice
 The Nurture Funder Community of Practice is an aligned community of funders that
 are learning, sharing, and experimenting with allocating financial capital in ways that
 are trust-based, coherent, and inclusive, in order to address social and environmental
 challenges from their roots.
 Regenerosity takes an experimental approach that aims not only at sharing
 knowledge, but also create a call-to-action environment, through helping to evolve the
 capacity of funders for redistributing power, upgrading methodologies, and reframing
 governance structures; creating collaborative prototypes for alternative types of
 funding; and generating stories that inspire other funders to transform their practices.
 Regenerosity believes in the power of shifting catalytic capital through trust-based,
 participatory practices, deep listening, and putting the voices of their partners at the
 forefront. They have catalyzed over 1.5M dollars to grassroots projects and continue
 to iterate and grow their programs.

 8. Next Steps
 and Call to
 Action

 “There’s a time for certain ideas to arrive,
 and they find a way to express themselves through us.”
 – Rick Rubin

Bioregional Finance is an idea whose time has come. There are already many
remarkable organizations, projects, and people working to actualize the spectrum
of ideas and recommendations laid out in this book. We are grateful to them for
inspiring us and feeding into this document.
With the publication of this book, the authors and our many collaborators will now
move from research and template design to designing, building, and implementing
BFFs through partnerships with Bioregional Organizing Teams and by catalyzing
broader action in Bioregional Finance. We invite stakeholders from around the
world, working across disciplines and sectors, to engage with us and with each
other to support the decentralization of financial resource governance, the design
of project portfolios for systemic change, and the transition to regenerative
economies. We recognize that while there is no single solution to the polycrisis,
Bioregional Finance can catalyze a global place-based movement that shifts value
structures, and enables each of us to contribute to healing the Earth and culture in
our unique ways.
In Table 12 below we lay out some potential actions for key categories of actors.247
While no two bioregions will follow the same path, we hope that through shared
learning and prototyping we can rapidly advance the field of Bioregional Finance
in an emergent, evolutionary way. While many of these actions may on the surface
look like to-do list items to check off, we suggest that they are all – including the most
technocratic and technical – recommendations to form and nurture relationships
of care, trust, healing, reciprocity, clear communication, and mutual learning. We
look forward to embarking on this journey with all of you. The forthcoming BioFi
Community of Practice on Hylo will be a key place for us all to engage.

247 These actions are not intended to be prescriptive and are not linear. We understand bioregional regeneration to be
 a complex, dynamic flow of actions and relations across multiple nested scales within a landscape and hope for
 these actions to support that process. We encourage you to consider that by reading this book, you are already an
 active participant in this movement, whether or not you identify with one of these categories. We encourage you to be
 curious about actions and relationships not listed that may be right for you to engage in.

 Emissary and The Matter With Things.
258 “During the slow sequence from exploitation to conservation, connectedness and stability increase and a capital of
 nutrients and biomass (in ecosystems) is slowly accumulated and sequestered. Competitive processes lead to a few
 species becoming dominant, with diversity retained in residual pockets preserved in a patchy landscape. While the
 accumulated capital is sequestered for the growing, maturing ecosystem, it also represents a gradual increase in
 the potential for other kinds of ecosystems and futures. For an economic or social system, the accumulating potential
 could as well be from the skills, networks of human relationships, and mutual trust that are incrementally developed
 and tested during the progression from exploitation to conservation. Those also represent a potential developed and
 used in one setting, that could be available in transformed ones.” (Resilience Alliance: Adaptive Cycle)

 Glossary

 Glossary
Anti-fragility – The quality of a system, entity, or process that allows it to not only
withstand — but actually benefit and grow stronger from — stress, volatility, and
uncertainty. Unlike fragile systems, which break under stress, or robust systems,
which withstand stress without changing, anti-fragile systems thrive and improve in
response to challenges and disruptions.

Biocultural regeneration – A holistic and interconnected approach to revitalizing
and restoring ecosystems, biodiversity, and cultural practices in a given spatial
context. It recognizes the interdependence of nature and culture, emphasizing the
importance of Indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices in stewarding
ecosystems.

Biodiversity – Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variety and variability of life
on Earth. Biodiversity is a measure of variation at the genetic (genetic variability),
species (species diversity), and ecosystem (ecosystem diversity) level.260

Bioregion – A region defined by unique physical characteristics (climate,
topography), ecological characteristics (such as soil, flora, fauna, and fungi), cultural
characteristics (such as language, art, and identity), and their interconnections.
There are many differing definitions of the scale and boundaries of bioregions,261
and this book celebrates this diversity as a critical insight about the lack of any
firm boundaries in ecosystems and the need to work with neighbors in bioregional
organizing.

Bioregional Hub – A community-led institution that functions as a gathering place
(physical and/or virtual), resource center, and facilitator of various regeneration-
related activities, initiatives, and networks within a bioregion. While Bioregional
Hubs can offer educational and capacity building programs, much like Bioregional
Learning Centers do, their focus extends to facilitating the flow of multiple forms of
capital (intellectual, social, cultural, etc.). They cohere and strengthen a synergistic
bioregional collaboration network by fostering connections and partnerships, and
catalyzing projects and initiatives that align with the Bioregional Regeneration
Strategy. See 3.3 Bioregional Hubs for detailed description.

260 UNEP: What is biodiversity?
261 One Earth: What is a bioregion? 22 ways to define a bioregion

Bioregional Learning Center (BLC) – An educational hub for gathering and
synthesizing knowledge about local ecology and culture.262 Centers typically
focus on education, research, and skill-building related to the specific ecological,
cultural, and social aspects of a bioregion. They offer various programs, workshops,
mutual learning exchanges, and courses that focus on topics such as ecology,
permaculture, sustainable living practices, Indigenous knowledge, and local history.
The primary goal is to provide opportunities for individuals and communities to
deepen their understanding of the unique characteristics and challenges of their
bioregion while equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary for
regenerative living and stewardship in place.

Bioregionalism – A socio-political and ecological philosophy that advocates for the
alignment of economic activity, ecological management, and governance with the
natural systems and cultures of "bioregions," defined by unique physical, ecological,
and cultural characteristics, and their interconnections. Bioregionalism suggests
that the invisible and visible regenerative efforts occurring across multiple scales
(individual, family, neighborhood, community, organization, ecoregion, global) can
be anchored and organized in large, bioculturally coherent landscapes that federate
through affinity, solidarity, and reciprocity to fulfill planetary potential.263

Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF) – A community-owned institution that applies a
participatory, transparent, and place-based approach to driving the decentralization
of financial resource governance, design of project portfolios for systemic change,
and the transition to a regenerative economy. While a BFF specializes in facilitating
the flow of financial capital between regenerative projects, community members,
and investors, it also works in close relationship with a Bioregional Hub to facilitate
the flow of all capital types (e.g social, intellectual, cultural) in holistic support
of bioregional regeneration. See 4. Designing and Implementing Bioregional
Financing Facilities for detailed discussion, templates, and case studies.

Bioregional Organizing Team – A team of local stakeholders that initiates a
bioregional regeneration and governance process, activates other stakeholders,
builds networks of relationality and trust, and facilitates the collective regeneration
efforts. See 3.1 Bioregional organizing and value creation for detailed discussion.

Bioregional Regeneration Strategy – A co-created, 20-100+ year or
multigenerational plan for regenerating a particular bioregion, including a guide to
the worldviews, values, processes, and principles recommended in approaching
the work. Strategies are ideally built upon comprehensive mapping and systemic
analysis and employ long-term thinking. See 3.1 Bioregional organizing and value
creation for detailed discussion.

262 Joe Brewer: What is a Bioregional Learning Center?
263 This is articulated in the vision, mission, and goals of the Regenerative Communities Network.

Bioregional Tithing – A program through which citizens residing or organizations
operating in the bioregion opt to “tithe” by donating a certain amount annually
or monthly (based on their income or profits) to the Bioregional Trust to support
regeneration of the bioregion they are tasked with stewarding. This program
recognizes that while all humans are meant to be stewards of the lands and waters
of their place, some are better placed to do this work directly, while others can
support them with financial resources. Inspiration can be taken from the Ohlone
Sogorea Te’ Land Trust and its calculator for the voluntary Shuumi Land Tax.264

Biosphere – The thin life-supporting stratum of Earth’s surface, extending from a few
kilometers into the atmosphere to the deep-sea vents of the ocean. It is composed
of living organisms and nonliving factors from which the organisms derive energy
and nutrients. The biosphere supports all life on Earth, estimated at 3 to 30 million
species of plants, animals, fungi, single-celled prokaryotes such as bacteria, and
single-celled eukaryotes such as protozoans.265

Carbon-tunnel vision – A myopic perspective that ignores the multiple
interdependent socio-ecological system crises that we face to focus only on carbon
emissions, and/or focuses solely on carbon emissions reductions as the key climate
change response.266

Cascading benefits – A term coined by Buckminster Fuller used to describe how
benefits from one well-designed change in a system can create enabling conditions
for other beneficial changes.

Common assets (also referred to as commons) – A type of resource that is
collectively owned, used, or engaged with by a group of people. Commons can
range from local resources like forests, fisheries, and urban spaces, to global
resources like the biosphere, atmosphere, digital networks, and data. Elinor
Ostrom's work challenged the traditional notion that commons are inevitably
subject to degradation or overuse ("the tragedy of the commons"), and instead
demonstrated through empirical studies that communities are capable of
developing effective rules and institutions to sustainably manage and govern
commons over the long term.267 “Commoning” and “re-commoning” are also
coming into increasing use as verbs to describe the practice of forming and
governing new commons or recovering historical commons from a present
privatized state.

Community organizing, weaving, and activation – The processes of gathering,
facilitating connection between, and empowering community towards a shared
purpose and vision. The Bioregional Weaving Labs consortium outlines five core
Weaving Practices: Helping systems see and sense themselves; Cultivating trust-
based relationship; Aligning on a shared purpose and vision; Facilitating collective
(un)learning; Fostering (experimental) action.268

 known cash gift to a Native land trust in history.

Complementary currencies – A form of currency or exchange medium that
operates alongside the national currency system, providing a means of transaction
and value exchange within a specific community or network. They are designed to
complement rather than replace national currencies and “to facilitate transactions
that otherwise wouldn’t occur, linking otherwise unused resources to unmet needs,
and encouraging diversity and interconnections that otherwise wouldn’t exist.”269
Complementary currencies can take various forms including local currencies, time-
based currencies, rewards programs, or digital/blockchain-based tokens.

Conviction Voting – An approach to collective decision-making where individuals
continuously express their preferences for the proposals they wish to support. They
may change their preferences at any time, but the longer they maintain their support
for a specific proposal, the greater the "strength" of their conviction becomes. This
gives community members with consistent preferences more influence than short-
term participants who may only seek to sway a single vote.270

Decentralization – The distribution of decision-making authority and management
responsibilities away from a centralized or top-down authority and toward a larger
group of diverse representatives, aiming to improve the efficiency, effectiveness,
and responsiveness of information processing, coordination, and decision-making
(notably, resource allocation).

Eco-credits – Attestations (i.e. validations) about ecological state which prove
regeneration is occurring, has occurred, or will occur. It is our recommendation
that eco-credits are based on community-developed and governed definitions of
regeneration that are rooted in local context and include a composition of ecological
factors (rather than a single, non-local parameter, such as carbon).271

Ecological integrity – The ability of an ecosystem to support and maintain ecological
processes and a diverse community of organisms.272

Ecoregion – A relatively large area of land or water that contains a geographically
distinct assemblage of plant and animal communities. Ecoregions can generally be
understood as encompassing biome subtypes (e.g. a grassland prairie biome can
include multiple different grassland ecoregions — tall grass, short grass, etc.).

Ecotones – A transition area between two ecosystems where they meet and
integrate. It may be narrow or wide, and it may be local (the zone between a field
and forest) or regional (the transition between forest and grassland ecosystems).
An ecotone may appear on the ground as a gradual blending of the two ecosystems
across a broad area, or it may manifest itself as a sharp boundary line.273

272 IPBES: Ecological Integrity
273 Wikipedia: Ecotone (“ecosystem” has been substituted for “biological community”)

Emergence – “Emergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise out
of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions.” It is these “simple interactions” –
from how we relate to the thoughts in our own heads, to how we show up in our
relationships, to how we exist as local communities – that create the patterns that
give rise to our ecosystems and societies.274

Financial sector – The segment of the global economy composed of institutions and
markets that facilitate the flow of funds between savers, borrowers, and speculators
managing financial assets and liabilities. It differs from the real sector, which
involves the production and exchange of tangible goods and services.

Financialization – A trend in which financial instruments and markets exert
disproportionate influence over real economic activities and policy, prioritizing
short-term speculative gains for the financial sector over long-term productivity and
health in the real sector.

Fractal – A pattern comprising parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the
whole, displaying self-similarity across scales. In nature, fractals can be observed
in patterns such as snowflakes, mountain ranges, and the branching of trees, blood
vessels, and watersheds.

Gaia Hypothesis – Introduced in the early 1970s by James E. Lovelock and Lynn
Margulis, the Gaia Hypothesis posits that Earth and its biological systems behave
as a single, global entity with closely controlled self-regulatory negative feedback
loops that keep the conditions on the planet within boundaries that are favorable
to life. This way of looking at global ecology and evolution differs from the classical
picture of ecology as a biological response to a menu of physical conditions.275

Indigenous – produced, growing, living, or occurring natively or naturally in a
particular region or environment.276

Indigenous peoples – A term holding immense complexity that is best defined within
specific context.277 However, for general interpretation throughout this book, we
suggest the term be understood as members “of a community retaining memories
of life lived sustainably on a land-base, as part of that land-base,”278 particularly
peoples practicing non-colonial knowledge systems rooted in relationships of
reciprocity with more-than-human life, and as a term of self-identification used by
those with “a special relationship with their traditional territory and an experience of
subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.”279 Note: In some
geographic contexts, ‘First Nations’ is used as a more specific term.280

274 adrienne maree brown: Emergent Strategy
275 ScienceDirect: Gaia Hypothesis
276 Merriam-Webster: Indigenous
277 We encourage great care with this term and caution against simplistic categorizations that ignore historical contexts
 of interrelatedness between peoples, and between all peoples and the entire land-base of Earth. We encourage deep
 listening and relationship-building with sources of Indigenous knowledge and dialogue in your contexts.
278 This quotation is sourced from Tyson Yunkaporta’s book Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World,
 which is an excellent resource for engaging with the depth and complexity of this term.
279 Wikipedia: Indigenous peoples
280 ‘First Nations’ is often used to identify Indigenous peoples of Canada (who are neither Inuit nor Métis) and to
 identify people with familial heritage from, and membership in, the ethnic groups that lived in Australia before British
 colonization.

Investment – For this book we have chosen to use the terms “investment” and
“investing” to describe all processes of providing financial resources. This builds on
an understanding that all forms of financial capital provision (equity, debt, donations,
grant-making, etc.) ideally yield returns, as in the traditional notion of “investment.”
However, sometimes these investments are designed to return financial capital and
at other times additional or other forms of capital (see “Multi-capital”). “Investment”
can also be used to describe the provision of non-financial capital, although this
book does not apply this meaning.

Islands of coherence – Ilya Prigogine, a renowned theoretical physicist and chemist,
used the concept of "islands of coherence" to describe emergent phenomena
in complex systems, particularly localized regions within a complex system
where coherence or order emerges spontaneously amidst overall disorder or
randomness. These islands of coherence are characterized by temporary stability
or organization that arises due to nonlinear interactions and feedback processes
within the system.

Kinship – Encomposses a complex and interconnected understanding of
relationships, identity, and responsibilities within human and more-than-human
communities. It is not merely a biological or legal concept, but encompasses
spiritual, cultural, familial, and historical dimensions.

Land Back – Also referred to with hashtag #LandBack, is a decentralized campaign
by Indigenous Australians, Indigenous peoples in Canada, Native Americans in the
United States, other Indigenous peoples, and allies alike, that seeks to reestablish
Indigenous sovereignty, with political and economic control of their ancestral
lands. Land Back promotes a return to communal land ownership of traditional and
unceded Indigenous lands and rejects colonial concepts of real estate and private
land ownership.281

Living in relationship to place – Having an intentional, embodied, and perhaps
spiritual connection and responsibility to specific lands, ecology, and place-
based culture. In contrast, many people in modern culture may experience a
“placelessness” – a disconnection from geographic roots due to factors like
globalization, technological change, and dominant culture that considers humans
as separate from nature.

Living system – Living systems, as contrasted with nonliving complex systems
– such as the stock market, computer simulations, or car traffic patterns – are
characterized by the following set of key features: complexity, self-organization,
interdependence, nested hierarchies, dynamic balance, and the emergent
properties of cognition, adaptation, and autopoiesis – the capability of a system to
produce and maintain itself by producing its own parts.282

281 Wikipedia: Land Back

Monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) – A process that ensures accuracy,
reliability, and transparency in reporting and measurements. The goal of MRV
is to verify that the data and information presented in reports, statements, or
performance measurements are truthful, consistent, and compliant with applicable
standards and regulations.

More-than-human life – A phrase that intentionally values all living beings and
elements of the natural world as interconnected and integral to life. This concept
emphasizes the agency, consciousness, and relational significance of non-human
entities.

Multi-capital/Multicapitalism – A framework that acknowledges and values different
forms of capital beyond traditional financial capital. A wide diversity of multi-capital
frameworks and definitions – including Indigenous concepts – have been proposed
in recent years to offer language for breaking out of the perception that money is the
only form of capital flowing around and through us.

Natural assets – The stocks of natural resources and ecosystems that provide
essential services and benefits to Gaia, society, local economies, and the global
economy. These assets include forests, wetlands, fisheries, clean air and water,
biodiversity, and other elements of the natural environment that contribute to the
well-being of life and economic prosperity.

Nature – Perhaps an undefinable term (e.g. where does it end?) it is mostly used in
this book to refer to the organic world (plants, fungi, animals (including humans),
ecosystems) as well as world features (hydrology, geology, climate) that western
science does not generally consider organic or alive, yet are being increasingly
recognized as interdependent with the organic world (see Gaia Hypothesis). Within
the context of other knowledge systems, it includes categories such as Mother
Earth and systems of life, and it is often viewed as inextricably linked to humans, not
as a separate entity.283

Nature-based Currencies – A type of complementary currency that bases its value
on the health and vitality of the local ecosystems – the ecological wealth – in a
given bioregion. While most currencies in circulation today are no longer linked to
physical assets, such as gold, communities deploying these new currencies can
use natural capital as a reserve asset to mint the financial capital needed to protect
ecosystems and support the livelihoods of their local stewards.284

Partner states – Multi-stakeholder cooperatives or commons-based institutions
responsible for the management and provision of certain public goods, common
assets, or services that were once the responsibility of state governments, which
instead provide funding and performance evaluation to partner states.285

283 IPBES: nature
284 Inspired by Open Earth Foundation: Nature Based Currencies
285 P2P Foundation Wiki: Partner State

Place – Where geographic reality and human culture intersect. It is the foundation
for culture and economy.286

Planetary boundaries – A scientific framework that presents a set of nine
biophysical thresholds, “within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive
for generations to come.” Crossing boundaries increases the risk of generating
large-scale abrupt or irreversible ecological changes.287

Polycrisis – “A time of great disagreement, confusion, or suffering that is caused
by many different problems happening at the same time so that they together
have a very big effect,” (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). Polycrisis is often used
interchangeably with “Metacrisis”, although some assert that “meta-” offers
a preferable distinction by denoting the interdependence (rather than mere
multiplicity) of crises and the worldviews/values that may be generating these
crises.288

Public good – In economics, a “public good" refers to anything that is both non-
excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning people cannot be barred access, and one
person's use doesn't degrade another's.289 Street lights, public databases, and
open-source patents or code are all examples. Public goods are different from
common assets, which can be rivalrous and made excludable through governance.

R Values – Jan Hania (Tuwharetoa, Raukawa-ki-teTonga, Te Atiawa of Aotearoa/
New Zealand and the Principal of Strategy Development for Biome Trust) uplifts
the “R values” of relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence,
regeneration, redistribution, and reconnection – noting that language must
be contextualized and place-based.290 The authors also uplift re-membering,
restorying, rewilding, and rematriation.

Real sector – the part of the global economy that produces goods and services,
rather than the part that consists of financial institutions and services.

Regeneration – The process of a system regaining its needed energies, resources,
and relationships to vitalize and sustain. Contrasted with “sustainability”, which
is oriented towards preserving and minimizing negative impacts, regeneration is
oriented towards restoring and revitalizing systems that have been degraded.

Regenerator – The individuals, communities, organizations, and networks actively
engaging in biocultural regeneration efforts. The specifier “on-the-ground” refers to
those working in consistent, embodied, and intimate relationship with ecosystems
and landscapes.

Returns – The outcomes (normally assumed to be positive, but could include
negative) generated for investors, stakeholders, and human and more-than-human
community across multiple forms of capital as a result of investments or actions.

Rights of nature – The recognition that our ecosystems – including trees, oceans,
animals, and mountains – have rights just as human beings have rights. Rather than
treating nature as property under the law, rights of nature acknowledges that nature
in all its life forms has the right to exist, persist, maintain, and regenerate its vital
cycles. And we – the people – have the legal authority and responsibility to enforce
these rights on behalf of ecosystems. The ecosystem itself can be named as the
injured party, with its own legal standing rights, in cases alleging rights violations.291

Right relationship/ right relation – As an aspirational quality or state of relationality
that can only be encountered in a unique web of relations and biocultural
understanding, it is not possible to offer a comprehensive and specific definition
of this term. Generally, however, “right relationship” connotes a harmonious way
of relating that is active, reciprocal, consensual, and sustainable (or regenerative)
across dimensions of past, present, and future, with respect to humans, more-than-
human-life, lands, and waters. The term is most often used to refer to Indigenous
ways of relating. Therefore, we recommend learning about relationality directly
from Indigenous sources and relationships, as translation across languages and
worldviews risks eroding its essential meaning.292

Stewardship – The responsible and ethical relating, tending, and nurturing of land,
resources, and ecosystems for the benefit of present and future generations of
human and more-than- human communities. Stewardship emphasizes a holistic
approach that prioritizes the well-being of the entire ecological system over
individual ownership rights, focusing on sustainability, resilience, and regeneration
of natural capital.293

Steward-ownership – A corporate ownership structure that presents an alternative
to shareholder value primacy. It ensures that companies prioritize their long-term
purpose over short-term profits – by legally enshrining two principles of Self-
Determination and Purpose-Orientation.294

Story of place – A holistic narrative that integrates the history, ecology, culture,
and potential of a specific location, guiding sustainable design and development
processes rooted in community stewardship and alignment with living systems
principles. Note: Story of Place® refers to a specific educational concept and service
offering of the Regenesis Group.295

 Voth: Indigenous relationality: definitions and methods
293 A note of caution for spanish speakers: steward is often translated as ‘mayordomo’ – a term originating from colonial
 structures of domination and control of land and people. ‘Cuidador/a’ or ‘guardiano/a’ are closer to the intended
 meaning.
294 Purpose Economy: What's steward-ownership?
295 Regenesis Group: Story of Place

Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) – The ongoing accumulation of knowledge,
practice, and belief about relationships between living beings in a specific
ecosystem that is acquired by Indigenous people over hundreds or thousands
of years through direct contact with the environment, handed down through
generations, and used in life-sustaining ways. It encompasses the world view of a
people, which includes ecology, spirituality, human and animal relationships, and
more.296

Transcontextual – The recognition that complex systems do not exist in single
contexts, but rather are formed between multiple contexts that overlap in living
communication and among living systems. “Warm Data” can be defined as:
Transcontextual information about the interrelationships that integrate a complex
system.297

Quadratic Funding – By allocating funds based on a quadratic formula that
magnifies the impact of many small investments from the community (similar to
crowdfunding) through a so-called ‘matching pool’ that is resourced by larger
capital providers, Quadratic Funding encourages widespread participation and
fosters a diverse array of projects that resonate with local communities. Projects
that receive a given amount of community funding from a broader base of
individuals receive more match funding than those that receive the given amount
from only a few community investors.298

Quadratic Voting – A method of collective decision-making where individuals assign
votes to reflect both the direction and intensity of their preferences. Participants can
allocate more votes to express stronger support for specific options, allowing them
to "purchase" additional votes on a particular matter, thereby aligning the voting
outcome with the highest willingness to pay, rather than solely the preference of the
majority. Payments for votes can be made using either artificial or real currencies,
such as voting tokens distributed equally among voting members or fiat and
complementary currencies with actual economic exchange value.299 (Lalley and
Weyl, 2018)

Wealth – True wealth is not merely money in the bank. It must be defined
and managed in terms of the well-being of the whole, achieved through the
harmonization of multiple kinds of wealth or capital, including social, cultural, living,
and experiential. It must also be defined by a broadly shared prosperity across all of
these varied forms of capital. The whole is only as strong as the weakest link.300

Weaving – Weaving is the practice of cultivating meaningful relationships, within,
between and across socio-ecological systems. It connects people, projects, and
places in synergistic and purposeful ways to help cohere fragmented change-
making efforts. It seeks to strengthen the socio-ecological fabric and the system’s
resilience by addressing the vital and relational aspects of trust, common meaning,
capacity for learning, and capacity for self-organization.301

Web3 – In contrast to the current internet era (Web2) characterized by centralized
platforms and services where user data is controlled by a few large corporations,
Web3 represents an emerging internet that is decentralized, enabled by blockchain
technology, where users have greater control over their data, identities, and
interactions through peer-to-peer networks and protocols.

Worldview – “A set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially
true or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or
inconsistently) about the basic makeup of our world.”302
