# The next big thing in finance is a lot of little things.

## What is a BFF?

BFFs are a new type of financial institution designed to serve the bioregional movement.

BFFs can drive the decentralization of financial resource governance, aggregation of synergistic portfolios of projects, and the transition to a regenerative economy ‚Äì becoming the connective tissue between financial resources and on-the-ground regenerators. They can do this by enabling capital raised from a variety of sources to flow to aggregated portfolios of systemically coordinated regenerative projects in rigorously designed, community-determined ways that support emerging bioregional economies applying fundamentally different economic logic and value systems. Rooted in the uniqueness of place and guided by Indigenous wisdom that invites us into kinship with nature, BFFs can enable the flow of capital to serve life.

**Bioregional Financing Facilities: connecting financial resources and regenerators**

![alt text](<Resources/BioFi Project Image.png>)

*There is a lack of connective tissue (trunk and branches) between those that hold and manage the large (and increasingly concentrated) pool of financial resources (leaves of the tree) and the coalitions of actors on the ground (regenerators) carrying out these critical regenerative activities (roots and mycelial network). BFFs can serve this function.*

## Key Messages from the Book

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Policymakers, institutional and individual wealth holders, and the general public are increasingly recognizing the severity of the current ecological collapse and the risk of further collapse cascading across our interdependent economic, political, and social systems.

- üí∏ Large pools of capital have been committed to 'nature' to respond to this crisis. However both traditional and novel institutional financing mechanisms and methodologies risk perpetuating the same extractive processes and power structures driving the crisis.

- üèû Many important regenerative projects and initiatives are led by people with deep relationships to place who are best positioned to both utilize this capital and support the design of contextually-sensitive financing practices more likely to produce regenerative outcomes.

- üîé However, these projects and initiatives, many of which are small scale and informal, are often structurally excluded from capital sources or considered illegible to capital holders.

- ü§ù Communities around the globe are building networks of bioregional collaboration and solidarity, creating Bioregional Learning Centers and Bioregional Hubs that grow capacity for place-based learning and coordination towards regenerative economies.

- üå≥ We propose "Bioregional Financing Facilities" (BFFs) as an institutional template to empower these networks by connecting pools of capital to regenerative projects and initiatives, and structuring these capital flows in alignment with living systems principles and Indigenous wisdom.

- Bioregional Financing Facilities drive:
  - ‚û°Ô∏è the decentralization of financial resource governance
  - ‚û°Ô∏è the design of project portfolios for systemic change
  - ‚û°Ô∏è and the transition to a regenerative economy.

- They become the connective tissue between:
  - üí∞ centralized financial resources
  - üçÑ and the mycelial network of regeneration.

- üåé BFFs can enable financial capital to support the strengthening of relationships between community members, between stewards and the lands and waters they tend, and amongst all of the more-than-human life and living processes in those lands and waters.

- üåª The warning signs from the Earth we are experiencing can be seen as an invitation to remember our interconnectedness with all life on the planet and begin embedding relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, respect, reverence, redistribution, reconnection, and critically, regeneration, in all that we design and build at this juncture ‚Äì including our financial systems.
