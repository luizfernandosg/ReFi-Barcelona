# What is BioFi?

At its core, BioFi is a framework that organizes the flow of financial capital and other multi-capital resources to the regeneration of ecosystems, culture, and communities in bioregions. More broadly, BioFi is also a philosophy rooted in and informed by: systems thinking, bioregionalism, living systems science, Indigenous ways of knowing, permaculture, the rights of nature, regenerative economics, nonviolence, decolonization, and social justice.

**BioFi aims to catalyze the transformation of financial and economic systems from those that are:**
- global,
- homogenized,
- abstract,
- and rooted in a reductionist paradigm

**to those that are:**
- place-based,
- community-owned and governed,
- relational,
- anti-fragile,
- aligned with living systems principles and Indigenous wisdom,
- and rooted in a Gaian (see [the Gaia hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/gaia-hypothesis#:~:text=Introduction,that%20are%20favorable%20to%20life.)) or [whole systems worldview](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/the-whole-is-more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts-9dcb0e1b6d85).

There are a wide range of BioFi-aligned tools, templates, mechanisms, and approaches â€“ a selection of which are laid out in the 2024 book *Bioregional Financing Facilities: Reimagining Finance to Regenerate Our Planet*. However, this is merely a sampling intended to provide definition to BioFi. There is a diverse global movement afoot of countless organizations and communities working in alignment with the patterns and principles of BioFi.

**Central to the BioFi approach are the following objectives:**
- Decentralize financial resource governance
- Organize systemic portfolios of projects (across space, time, sectors, communities, and organizations)
- Deploy investment to catalyze the transition to bioregional, regenerative economies (that are less dependent on external financial capital and financial capital in general over time).
- Plan geographically in alignment with geological, ecological, and cultural patterns (rather than political boundaries)
- Work at nested geographical and systemic scales
- Work across long time horizons (in order to shift the ecology, culture, economy, and governance in a place to those aligned with living systems patterns and principles)
- Embrace complexity and relationality
- Work with the regenerative potential of life (see [Capra](https://www.fritjofcapra.net/principles-of-life/) and [Kauffman et al](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2022.0063).)
