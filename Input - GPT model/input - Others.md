The purpose of the local nodes is to expand the network of ReFi to points that hasn't been reached

We want to establish a network of value-aligned partners that can kickstart 

We want to:
1. Connect existing value-aligned organizations and individuals to start creating networks of mutual support
2. To support the connection and creation of ReFi-related initiatives in the local context of Barcelona and Catalonia

On:
2. As the name suggests, finances are an integral aspect of Regenerative Finance. A core idea of ReFi is to plug the capitalization of positive real-world action into financial exchanges and other operations - as a way to kickstart a network of agents working towards the regeneration of the planet and everything that it entails (nature, life, work, personal relationships, ...).
3. We don't want to create from scratch, though.
4. Barcelona and Catalonia already have a vivid ecosystem of cooperative projects. We want to connect value-aligned players that are already operating and have experience. The idea is that these value-aligned projects can 

While main ecosystem is the ReFi - DAOs

- What is ReFi BCN and the purpose of this session?
	- ReFi Barcelona:
		- A local node is a community that meets regularly to build a regenerative society in their country, city, town, or village
		- Local nodes are designed to fulfill three core objectives:
			1. Onboard talent and capital into the regenerative economy
			2. Create radical startup experiments for publicly-verifiable impact
			3. Build public, private, and civil society partnerships
		- an initiative focused on propelling the development of the Regenerative Finance movement in Barcelona.
		- to play the role of creating bridges between the ReFi and local ecosystems.
	- The purpose of this session:
		- Brainstorm hypotheses for ReFi BCN
		- start developing ReFi DAO’s local node canvas
		- identify key initiatives and action plans
		- prepare a roadmap with initiatives
		- engage and onboard contributors
		- start recurrence of meetings
- Brainstorming hypotheses for ReFi Barcelona
	- What assumptions can ReFi BCN explore and experiment with to propel the ReFi movement and catalyze local regeneration in Barcelona? (10 minutes)
		- Real-World Projects
			- How can we incubate local regenerative projects, especially ones that are not tech focused?
			- People in Barcelona are collaborative. How do you bring in all the sectors?
			- How can we convey that currency/money is not the only output to be expected/neccesary from a productive project?
			- What are the easiest ways to promote collaboration and shared ownership of resources and individual participation/creativity?
			- Connect with non-crypto people working on nature-based projects on the ground
			- How can we connect civic change projects with nature-based projects to create an ecosystem of solutions?
			- How can we create nets of collaboration, bringing the knowledge from regenerative experts or projects on the ground. Barcelona has a lot of cooperatives and grassroots movements.
			- The small scale and having people together at the same place can be an opportunity to connect the connect the web3 world with on the ground impact. Tokenization of practices?
			- Can we collaborate with impactful local companies?
			- the ReFi ecosystem is still lacking real-world impact
			- identifying areas that where we could do the most impact
		- Onboarding projects & people
			- How can we create creating acces to web3 / refi / defi relevant documentation Translating material Creting communication channels (social media audience, printinc, courses)
			- How can we normalize the language so everyone can be onboarded?
			- How can we make web 3 less scary/overwhelming for new people? (+2)
			- how can we make it easier to understand? make it simpler to explain an also accessible to everyone
			- there’s still low awarenness of what ReFi it. a local node can play the role of onboarding people and projects to the ReFi ecosystem
			- Explore current community currency projects and see if there are opportunities to support them with tech.
			- Talk to existing regeneration projects and ask what they need and what they struggle with, see how refi can help
		- Funding
			- How can we bootstrap the local node and stay independent but still sustainable financially as well as provide good quality support for the local initiatives/ do good events?
			- Creating a system that internalizes externalities - to create a circular economy, we need to have the right economic tools
			- web3 tech can already be beneficial to already-existent local projects to attract funds
			- Should we find sources of seed capital for retroactive public goods funding rounds?
			- Will finding retroactive public goods funding rounds opportunities for already ongoing projects help them grow?
			- How can we move from funding new fundraising mechanisms/ fundraising platforms and focus in the actual real world impact?
			- ReFi BCN and the  network of local nodes can coordinate collective efforts to optimize capital allocation
		- From the kick-off event:
			- Input economico con output que no necesariamente es economico, sino bienestar
			- Regeneracion de como deberia funcionar el sistema humano-humano
			- herramienta para desviar recursos capitalistas hacia la regeneracion, somos las personas que lo alimentan
			- bridge the funds and value of web3 to the real world
			- collaborative finances - people own money with no intermediary
			- sense-making and practical application of web3
			- systems of organization with positive external effects, contributing to its environment instead of extracting value - get incentives to take care of the planet
			- creating a financial system - (i dont blame people for heating the planet, people want to max their financial gain) - transparent
