# ReFi-Barcelona

This repository is representing the knowledge base of ReFi Barcelona. It is a collection of files containing markdown and metadata.

These files could be used to generate web-based project directories using arbitrary generators for static websites like Obsidian Publish, Jekyll or Gatsby.

Using git repositories to fork, pull and merge repositories from and into another is way to share profiles between the knowledge bases of different projects.
